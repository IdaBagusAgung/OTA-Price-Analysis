With two optic fiber lines and battery backup and generator, you'll have lightning-fast internet for video conferences and focused work.The private kitchen boasts marble benchtops, a gas cooker, and a Nespresso coffee machine, as well as all the necessary utensils for your stay. There is also a well-appointed kitchen with a 100-liter fridge. The bathroom is small but modern. There's even an outdoor shower for a refreshing rinse after a day at the beach.Due to the small nature and style of the villa, it is set up to be a private oasis where you can chill, relax, soak, and reset. Therefore, we do not provide guests with breakfast, and encourage guests to use the Nespresso machine, cook, or try food from the village. We recommend you purchase food supplies before coming or shop from the local market or village as Balian is remote. For fancier Western food, there are some, but limited, delivery services we can help you with once you have made your booking. These would need to be arranged one day before your arrival.Situated on the northernmost section of the land, our villa has a westerly outlook that is perfect for sunsets. Watch local fisherman and farmers go about their days the same way they have for hundreds of years, or swim on the beach just footsteps from your villa.

The surrounding area offers many activities and sights, including surfing, cafes, secluded black-sand beaches, old-growth forests, and coastal caves and waterfalls to explore.Guest accessGuests will have access to the villa they have booked. On the property, there are currently two villas: the main villa, which is our home base, and our tiny house. Guests will share the entrance to the villa and paths through the property. Upon their arrival, they will be greeted by our Villa Host at the main entrance. The Villa Host will give them a tour of the property and take them to the entrance of their private villa. We are building a gym which will be shared between guests. The main gate should be kept closed, but the Villa Host will provide guests with instructions on how to open the entrance gate so they can come and go freely. Each villa is secluded and private and is either screened by walls or garden walls. Each Villa has direct access to the beach via the rice field and coconut grove, with the path across the rice field and down to the beach being shared.Other things to noteWe recommend guests bring or purchase food to cook in our kitchen. Daily house keeping is included or alternatively if you would like full privacy we can also arrange at your request.We have massage service available at additional costs, and transport service available. Scooters can be provided at additional charge.We have 3 dogs on the property, Max, Blackie & Coal. They are lovely dogs and part of our family.",

Some days you might smell fresh paint, hear music drifting from the studio, or see new works being printed.If you value authentic luxury with character, this is your place.Not a resort. Not a retreat. A home where life lives real.💡 What makes this home specialOnly 50 m from the beach — ocean breeze, no trafficArchitecture between brutalist and sensualPart of a working artist’s homeOptional art sessions (silk-screen, painting, textile)Boutique interior curated by Grisbelle – Canvas + ConcreteGuest accessGuests stay in their own self-contained apartment on the front side of our property, just steps from the ocean.Each apartment has:a private entrance from the shared garden,a private rooftop terrace with sea view,a private kitchen, living area, and bathroom,and direct access to the pool area of the main villa.The property layout is open but carefully designed: two apartments in front, our main villa at the back, all surrounded by palms, green walls, and open sky.You’ll feel privacy and space — but you’ll also feel that this is a lived place, not a resort.We (your hosts) live and work here in the main villa, where our art studio and our two large, gentle dogs are also part of the daily rhythm.You may hear us printing in the atelier, walking through the garden with the dogs, or setting up a canvas outside.Guests are always welcome to visit the studio, talk about art, or join a screen-printing session if you wish. We’re nearby if you need anything — but we’ll always respect your privacy.Most guests describe the experience as “having their own private home inside an artist’s compound by the sea\"Other things to noteThis is not a resort — it’s a living, breathing home.We share the property with our two large, gentle dogs who roam freely around the garden and pool.They are calm, affectionate, and part of the family — but if you’re uncomfortable with dogs, this might not be the right stay for you.Because this is an artist’s compound, you may occasionally hear the sounds of life: the soft hum of a print dryer, music drifting from the atelier, the ocean just beyond the trees.It’s part of the rhythm here — creative, organic, alive.Your apartment is completely private, with its own kitchen, garden, and rooftop terrace.The pool area is shared between the two guest apartments and our main villa.We keep the space clean, elegant, and relaxed — barefoot luxury with texture and soul.It’s for guests who value design, authenticity, and a genuine sense of place more than perfection or predictability.If that sounds like you, you’ll love it here.",

Enjoy exploring the the rice terraces on your doorstep for amazing photos, ask Wayan to show you the river in the valley below (ice cold for a swim), or explore local walks and hidden local food options.Other things to noteThe house is open to nature - this can mean that moths, geckos, and frogs can make an appearance from time to time. The noise of the wildlife can also sometimes be louder than what some guests are used to. Wayan and family are always on hand to help remove unwanted creatures, but please remember that this house is designed to bring you closer to nature, not to block it out, so please be aware of this when booking.",

  "description": "Stylish, comfortable and fully-equipped holiday home with spacious living room and three bedrooms and bathrooms, an infinity pool, uninterrupted sea view (with Lombok and the Gilis on the horizon), and direct beach access.It’s a quiet place surrounded by beautiful gardens, with mountains in the back, and sea / beach in the front.Several restaurants with local and international cuisine as well as a spa are just a few steps from the property.The spaceThe house consists of a spacious living room and a fully equipped kitchen with dining table for 6 people (50 m2), two bedrooms (20 m2 each), each with a super king size bed (200 x 200 cm), spacious built-in wardrobe (also to put suitcases), a desk, a smart TV, fan and aircon, and adjacent open air bathrooms (10 m2 each), and downstairs a bedroom with bathroom (around 25 m2 in total) with king size bed (180 x 200 cm), a wardrobe, fan and aircon. The infinity pool is 8 x 3.5 m and there is a terrace (3 x 5 m) with open air shower. The house is built sustainably using natural stone, carbon-negative concrete, reclaimed ironwood (ulin), rattan, and cogon grass (alang-alang). Together with its thoughtfully curated, custom-made furnishings, it offers a perfect blend of traditional Balinese and modern design.A slightly larger version of this house can be booked here (subject to availability): https://www.airbnb.com/l/nGGByYztGuest accessThe entire house is available for guests.Other things to noteBreakfast, lunch and dinner can be delivered from one of the nearby restaurants to the house (additional charge).A few hundred meters from the Japanese shipwreck, one of Amed’s main snorkeling / diving spots. Amazing corals can also be found right in front of the house, directly reachable from the property and beach in front. Indeed, the coral reef fauna of the Lombok Strait, being one of the main passages for the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) that exchanges water between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and part of the Wallace Line, is one of the most diverse and richest in the world.Waking up to see the sun rise from behind Mount Rinjani, Lombok, and traditional fishing boats (jukung) with their colorful sails leave the shore (and in between, 20 kilometers down, large \"post Malaccamax\" ships cross the Lombok Strait to benefit from the >250 meter deep sea) is one of the experiences that will make your stay at Océa Amed unforgettable.Note: Depending on the season and tides, there is sometimes a limited beach in front. Please contact us for up-to-date information.Less suitable for young children (infinity pool) and the elderly (steep stairs).",

  "description": "The spaceSet amidst lush jungle and forested slopes, this 5-star villa is at the heart of the eye-catching Hanging Gardens of Bali. Shining stone floors, exceptional decor and soaring, longhouse style roofing runs throughout the exterior, while tropical flowers, sparkling pool and cushioned, forest-hugged relaxation areas abound outside. Waterfalls, scenic rice terraces and adventure sports are all nearby.Evoke a spirit of royal luxury on the upland slopes of Bali with this exceptionally well-outfitted home. The villa radiates a regal atmosphere with the central sitting room’s rich dark wood furniture, decorative veils and golden lanterns. Start the morning with a revitalising sunbathing session on one of the many poolside recliners, before diving into the azure pool for complete refreshment. Relax on the study chair and take in the forest mists burning off under the morning sun, before gathering in the shaded exterior couches to organize another thrilling day in this picturesque part of Bali. As red-skyed evenings unfold, stroll the garden as the calls of distant macaque monkeys and woodland songbirds echo through the air, before retiring to long, mirror-clad bathrooms and comfortable beds.The Hidden Palace is located to the north of Bali’s more tourist-oriented southern coast, amid winding lanes and serene rice paddies. Travel in minutes some of the less-explored delights of the island’s countryside, including crystalline, roaring waterfall viewpoints, zip-line activities, and elephant refuges. Get ready to indulge in refreshing drinks at roadside cafes, or experience the still peacefulness of mountain temples and sacred stone pools.Copyright © Luxury Retreats.

  "title": "Luxury 4 Bedroom Cliff Ocean Edge Villa Uluwatu",
  "description": "The Luxe Bali is an extremely high end 4 floor family friendly 4 bedroom luxury villa right above Padang Padang Beach Uluwatu in an exclusive 3 villa gated estate.Enjoy private cliff edge views of the surf break and beach below with a private  garden pathway to the oceans edge.4 floor lift, gym, spa, sauna, steam room, home theatre, butler, master chef, housekeeping, 3 pools, lush gardens and fine art are but a few of it's unique qualitiesThe spaceTo ensure you will have the best holiday possible regardless of where you book, please read our advice here.The Luxe Bali is not in anyway your average 'luxury villa', a term perhaps a little too generously used online.  If you are already reading this here then you are spending a considerable amount of money for a vacation,  please be as informed as possible of what you are getting and more to the point what you will be getting here and not be getting elsewhere for that money. If you have already experienced the quaint rustic or the all visual flash but not real quality , or located on the cliffs with an extremely long and steep walk  to reach the ocean way below villa experiences and would now like to experience a beyond first class residence in comfortable  location, facility and service that you would absolutely love to live in for the rest of your life then this is the villa for you. A true blend of the finest elements the west and east can put together. Most lean too much either way, The Luxe Bali has found that perfect harmonious middle point between fine finish natural materials and absolute high-end comfort.  Understated ZEN.  Unlike most villas on the island The Luxe Bali is unique in that it was built with an totally unlimited budget by a very high net worth individual as a second home, one the owner wanted to be as beautiful, comfortable, and facilitated as possible. Not spending as much time in Bali these days the owner has put the villa up for selected rental when they are not at the villa . So you will be experiencing the home of a high net worth individual with impeccable taste and eye for detail.  A nine-year build by the finest craftsmen from all over the world, this is the time it took to get everything to the meticulous quality standards the owner desired. The Architect of the world famous KuDeTa Restaurant in Seminyak was selected to design the villa.    There are  villas around with more bedrooms for larger groups  but more luxurious ?  we have yet to see any that have taken it to the level of our residence.  Most villas loudly promoted in the ‘luxury' category would be lucky to qualify as low end  airline business class equivalents, whereas The Luxe Bali is without any doubt up there with the finest airlines first class offerings and at a fraction of what those flights cost.  The 1200 m2 (13,000 ft2) of living space boasts Four Master Suites with their own lounge area and en suite bathroom containing separate shower and bath space, with each having private terrace or direct access opening to the cliff edge pool. The fourth floor Penthouse Suite features a stunning 88 m2  (950 ft2) of open marble terrace, one of the premier spots in Bali from where you can see the cliffs running down the coast, the surf right out front of you, and the distant shores of Kuta, Seminyak and Canggu across the vast ocean bay and also to enjoy the spectacular light show every sunset brings.  Beside this in the evening there no black void looking into the dark ocean abyss when the sun goes down as the twinkling lights of the Kuta - Seminyak shoreline can be seen across the bay. The King-size Beds strategically placed to catch the views have the most comfortable absolute top end mattresses available; high thread count cotton sheets and a variety of hardness non-allergic microfiber pillows.    The third floor feature two grand bedroom suites with stunning ensuite bathrooms with separate showers and baths and outside terraces, these are the OceanView Suite and the Rainforest Suite.The second floor is the living dining upper ground level. It contains several lounge areas, family tv area, a grand dining area , a celebrity kitchen using absolute top shelf appliances with a master chef and butler included. This floor at one end leads to a beautiful rainforest grove complete with two large banyan trees, a multitude of ferns, palms, waterfalls and koi ponds, the other end of the second floor is an unrestricted view of the ocean with cliffs running down to Balangan Beach. Stand at the edge of the lawn and watch the surfers paddling by. The Cliff Edge Pool Suite is located on the lower ground floor and contains either two single beds or a king size double bed (as requested), and spacious private lounge space that opens out directly onto the large cliff edge pool, pergola and gardens. The fourth bedroom has a bathroom with a luxurious high flow shower (no bath) and when desired this suite can be locked from the rest of the villa  to be a self contained apartment with it's own private entrance. This space is perfect for  high end clients that travel with an assistant and desire them to be close by but not too close. The  lower ground level also holds the fun zone , with a gym, a dry redwood cedar sauna, a steam room, massage spa, and dedicated home theatre.  The Meals. The very talented Chef prepares meals of the highest standard of quality and flavour. Many guests come with the intention of eating out at the high end restaurants Bali is so well know for, but after experiencing the quality of the in-house chef prepared meals served by your own butler and waiter, they often forgo the visits to other restaurants. Guests are charged a 20% surcharge for groceries and produce and the chef prepares meals from that.  The cost saving for meals alone becomes quite significant. Please Read the guest reviews about the meals. The same with Drinks, the villa does not sell drinks, but rather authentic origin bottles of wines and spirits are purchased at a 20% surcharge and the butler with a significant saving for you mixes cocktails. The property was purchased well before most any other property on the southern peninsular at a time when they had the choice and means to buy anywhere and sat on for a decade while planning the grounds.  Being already well informed on building locations and sun orientation they noticed two significant features almost no other site on the coastline provided.  Firstly the property actually faces north across the ocean with Mt Agung and the other volcanoes of Bali in the distant background. What this aspect means is a significantly cooler space where you get ocean views all day long without the intense and often uncomfortable heat of the sun beaming into and heating up your villa, and secondly this site is one of less than a handful with terraced grounds all the way down to just above the waters edge.  Once again, this is not a villa built on a normal business budget as a as an upmarket hotel might; they often are the obvious ones all bundled together like cookie cutter suburbs.  This is a unique high net worth owners villa in a very private gated estate of only three properties all built and owned by three high net worth individuals. No look after 70 villa  management companies, no built by a developer or commercial operation  and the significantly lower quality build, fixtures and infrastructure one will undoubtedly get from such a set up, rather a truly unique villa of the highest order in a unique setting. Please read our guest comments, you will see by glowing reviews how much previous guests have appreciated what they experienced and how much they enjoyed their stay.  You really owe it to yourself. The Prices are for a rental of all Four (4) bedrooms.  with up to 8 Adults and 3 children A 3 Bedroom option for up to 6 Adults and 2 children  ,  a 2 Bedroom option for up to 4 Adults  (or 2 adults 2 children ) , and a 1 Bedroom option for  up to 2 Adults are available Any numbers outside of these please message me so we can work something out.

We can provide with lineen and pilow for 25 USD per night per daybed + 15,5% Service and Tax.2 infants can be accommodated in 2 baby cots free of charge.Guest accessWhen the entire estate is booked, guests have full privacy and will have exclusive access to all the property except for the reserved areas for the staff and the technical installation rooms of the property.Other things to noteOnce in the property, if the guests wish to order any meal, the Chefs will calculate the cost of the groceries depending on the guests´ order and after receiving a Deposit and doing the shopping, the Butlers will hand the bills and the change from the supermarket with no extra charges except for a small fee of 100.000 IDR (around 6 USD) that should be handed directly to each chef, every day their services are needed, so they cover the transportation expenses to buy the groceries.Every meal should be ordered at least 4 hours ahead, so the chefs have time to do their estimation for the costs, buy the groceries, and prepare all the dishes.Normally, the butlers and the housekeepers will take care of breakfast, and the Chefs take care of lunch and dinner.In case the geusts plan to have both lunch and dinner at the villas, it is better to order the day before, or early in the morning, to the butlers, so the Chefs only have to go once to buy the groceries.Normally, there is a suggested maximum order per meal of 5 dishes plus dessert, but as some dishes are easy and other dishes are more complicated and take longer times to cook, it is better to talk directly with the Chefs once the guests are in the villas, so they can let them know if the maximum number of dishes can be exceeded or if there are dishes requiring a longer time to cook.For breakfast there is no menu, but guests can order between American and Continental breakfast, whatever they like. Our butlers will be able to provide them with more details upon arrival to the property.",

Spread across lotus ponds, this graceful villa is comprised of a main house and an ocean-facing guesthouse. This villa channels open-air living among the elements and infuses Balinese spirit with decadent luxury. \n\nWith a traditional thatched alang-alang roof above the airy living space, guests can gather on the heritage wooden and bamboo sofas with plush white soft furnishings. The living room is the social hub of the villa, where guests can gather and socialise together while admiring the breathtaking views. In the dining area, guests can feast on a banquet created by the in-house chef, who lovingly prepares Balinese, Asian or Western meals in a restaurant-standard kitchen.\n\nThe master suite has an enormous, comfortable bed and floor to ceiling windows where the guests can wake up to enchanting views of the greenery and the sounds of the ocean waves. The guests in this room can enjoy a refreshing dip in the exclusive plunge pool right outside. The ocean pavilion bedrooms in the main house are decked out in dramatic dark wood with quirky furniture and also have enormous windows and panoramic sea views.\n\nAll bedrooms have open air bathrooms, with the master bedroom also featuring a traditional shower reminiscent of Bali's many famous waterfalls. There's a stunning sunken bathtub where guests can try a relaxing Balinese petal bath. The ocean pavilion bathrooms are decorated in nature-inspired earth tones. \n\nIf you need a break from the outdoors, retire to the air conditioned media room, where you'll find a satellite TV encased within an ornate wooden cabinet, complete with Bose surround sound system and comfortable sofas to unwind on.\n\nOutside, guests can swim in the luxurious infinity pool, soaking up the dreamy atmosphere and looking out to the ocean mere steps away.

There are three Hindu temples within the 1.5 acres of lush greenery, where you can experience a peaceful moment of spirituality.\n\nThe beautiful garden balé is one of the most photogenic parts of the villa - it's no wonder this villa is so popular for wedding parties!

The area is quieter and a little more under the radar, with new patisseries and yoga studios popping up all the time. \n\nThe villa is just a few moments from Batu Belig beach. Enjoy 100m of uninterrupted bliss on the striking black sand - and the rest of the beach is particularly family friendly and peaceful. While the waves are too strong for any serious swimming, you can rent a body board to ride the waves. Soak up the relaxing vibe and watch the famous sunset - if you venture further down the beach you can grab a snack from a nearby cafe or local warung. You can watch kite flying here, a popular pastime in Bali. However, if you're here in July or August, you can watch Bali's annual traditional kite flying festival.\n\nBe sure to take advantage of the villa's private driver to visit cosmopolitan Seminyak itself. As Bali's premiere upscale beach resort, Seminyak is a playground for jet-setters, fashionistas and yogis. It's full of fashionable boutiques where you can shop til you drop and fancy spas, where you can indulge in a quintessentially Balinese massage and spend the day getting pampered. Bali is the ideal place to try out yoga. There are stunning studios dotted all around Seminyak, so grab a mat and sign up for a taster course.\n\nOne of the best local attractions is Finn's Recreation Club. Boasting a water park with thrilling slides popular with kids and adults alike; a state of the art gym, blissful spa, vast tennis court and boxing arena, there's something for everyone here. A memorable day out for the whole family!\n\nYou'll find plenty of surf schools where you can get acquainted with the waves and learn from the professionals. After the sun softens, hang out at one of the many alluring beach clubs for a panoramic sunset view over the Indian ocean - famous Ku De Ta and Potato Head are both nearby.\n\nArt lovers will adore the hip galleries around Seminyak, such as Biasa ArtSpace at the forefront of contemporary Indonesian art such as installations of brass head busts with red eyes. Hotel Tugu Bali is an interesting museum-hotel hybrid full of priceless Indonesian art and antiques. Here, there's also a fabulous award-winning spa offering traditional Eastern therapies, so it's an ideal place to spend a leisurely afternoon.\n\nThe villa is also a short drive from the sweeping rice terraces, ancient fishing villages and dramatic volcanoes of Tabanan. This area is great for a hike or a gentle walk. \n\nMagical Petitenget Beach embodies Balinese spirituality, and Pura Petitenget is a significant link in the series of temples along Bali's west coast between Pura Uluwatu and Pura Tanah Lot. Pura Petitenget is an ancient temple that has twelve shrines and an impressive dragon staircase that leads to an expansive courtyard. Every evening, there are temple ceremonies on the beach and traditional dance displays - a truly mesmerising way to experience the rich culture. \n\nTake a 30-minute drive to Pura Tanah Lot, a religious site perched high atop a wave-lashed rock formation. It's believed that the temple here protects Bali from evil sea spirits. Pura Tanah Lot is also a popular spot for sunset. Soak up the experience of locals praying and admire the ocean turn to gold in the evening light.\n\nTerms & Conditions:\n\n?\nClient's cards details may be requested as guarantee.\n\n2pm.\n\n12pm.\n\nIncluded in rental price.\n\nYes, including pool towels.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nFlexible.\n\nYes.

A great activity here is to ride a bicycle or scooter down the Shortcut, which is a delightfully scenic path through the rice plantations. Just be careful when you move to the side to let others pass, as the locals are busy making a book of all the falls into the rice fields! \n\nBali is known as the 'Island of the Gods' and is home to countless enchanting temples. Take a 30 minute drive to Pura Tanah Lot, a religious site perched atop a rock formation. It's believed that the temple here protects Bali from evil sea spirits. Pura Tanah Lot is also a popular spot for sunset, soak up the experience of locals praying and admire the ocean turn to gold in the evening light.\n\nThere are plenty of fun activities around Canggu town, including having a traditional Balinese massage at a fancy spa, yoga and crossfit studios and some incredible cafes serving up delicious food.

Attention to detail goes to another level here when the best Finnish lighting architect was commissioned for the lighting of the house and Bonsai trees were imported directly from Badung.THE POOL AREA:The 10metre lap pool has a shallow kid friendly end and a rain curtain water feature and lies next to the barbecue/open air lounge area. The sun loungers in the grass area next to the pool are perfect for a morning suntan. Wait until night to see the rain curtain light up in different colours. Sunset time calls for a cold Chardonnay while preparing some T bone steaks at the barbecue. Sit back and enjoy the view of the Onyx wall that perfectly lights up the space, while the kids can run around at the grass area nearby or swim at the pool.The barbecue/open air lounge area is fully equipped with a large fridge to store drinks and food, a sink, a super deluxe stainless steel gas barbecue, a huge comfortable built-in corner sofa and ceiling fans by the glass roof. We should not forget to mention the JBL party box 1000 portable speaker! There are also 2 showers next to the pool.THE OPEN PLAN LIVING AREA:Dining area:As you enter the villa, the 10seater dining area with its impressive light fixture next to the dry kitchen that screams perfection will have you at hello. It is also the perfect setting for special occasions. The villa chef is ready to assist and prepare a dinner that your guests will remember. The pool view straight from the huge double-glazed windows adds to the scenery.Step-down living room:The step-down living room next door with a glass window on the same level as the pool, which gives the sensation you are floating on water. One cannot help but marvel at the two perfectly lit portraits of monks from renowned photographer and artist Ben Kustow. Dry & wet kitchens and laundry room:The villa also features two fully equipped kitchens – one dry with a marble bench used for special occasions and one wet for everyday use. Both kitchens are fully equipped, while the wet kitchen also has a chilled wine cabinet (apart from the fridge/freezer). There is a laundry room next to the wet kitchen with both a washing machine and a dryer. THE UPSTAIRS OPEN SPACE LOUNGE AREA:As you walk up to the 3rd floor you are greeted by some immense windows with the best view followed by huge white corridors with paintings by renowned artist Neil Adams.

Drinks are served from the bar next door and placed at the Onyx table that perfectly lights up the space.We cannot help but mention the juice bar following the Onyx theme of the house with yet another impressive portrait by famous photographer Ben Kustow.THE FANCY DETAILS THAT CANNOT BE LEFT OUT:Yoga shala:Next to the juice bar, lies an open space yoga Shala with a wooden floor that can fit up to 10 people (yoga mats available for free).

Sit back on the rattan swing chair or bean bag and elevate your Shisha experience by placing real fruits inside.THE MASTER BEDROOM SUITE:The master bedroom is the epitome of luxury: a super king size bed, a 65inch ultra-high-definition smart TV with Netflix, a home cinema with JBL portable wireless speakers and your very own bar where you can prepare your morning coffee and have a sip on your private balcony facing the pool and garden.Take some sparkling wine and head over to the en-suite ultra luxury marble bathroom.

If you need a 6th nice bedroom, there is a studio that can be rented.The spaceThe villa was completed in September 2023 and is by far one of the best in the area ...! if you’re looking for  luxury then this is it.We are basically on 3 levels- the lower ground/basement (which is actually at street level- it's not underground as it were), the middle floor- and the top floor. We have a super nice 15 metre salt water pool with a shallow end for the kids.The villa has a private staircase within the complex that leads to Uluwatu beach- roughly 3 minutes door to sand :) We have an ice bath, this can fit up to 6 people and cools to around 10 degrees celsius. Perfect for post surf recovery.We also have a private car and driver that can be hired as well as scooters on site. This requires some notice though. The house comes with daily housekeeping and a breakfast, the team are generally available from 8 am to 7pm for queries and requests. Please treat the staff with respect as you would your friends.ACCOMODATIONWe have 4 spacious bedrooms- each around 30+ square metres- apart from the Master, which is HUGE- 45 sq m. The Master bathroom is also ridiculously big- 36 sq m! Each bedroom (apart from Bedroom 4 and the TV room which share one)  has a large en suite bathroom. There is a 5th room can be set up either as a bedroom or a TV room depending on your preference. Unless pre advised, this room will be come as a TV room. (We are aware the title of the listing says 6 bedrooms- this is not our preference- this is a quirk with Airbnb where they take that number from the picture gallery where we do indeed have 6 bedrooms- but as you will read from below, not all are equal!)The TV/Cinema room and 4th Bedroom - are both separated from each other by sliding glass doors with a corridor in between. Both rooms have curtains- so they are separated, but also all the doors can be opened and it becomes one large 55 sq metre suite. Everything has been finished with high end luxury materials, marble bathrooms etc. Each bedroom in the villa has its own minifridge and safe deposit box. Basically the rooms are like hotel rooms....fully equipped. We even offer slippers and kimonos for use during your stay.If you would like to just have for example two bedrooms instead of 4/5 do please let us know and we can consider to lower the rate a little . We cannot guarantee this especially during peak seasons like December July and August but we can do our best to at least try and help...no guarantees:)If you would like a 6th bedroom, we have a super nice private studio- including its own pool and kitchen- this can be rented separately via another Airbnb link- this is called the Summer Ulu Studio and is attached to the main villa but is also very private. https://www.airbnb.com/h/summerulustudioFinally, just to confuse you more,, we actually also have ready a dedicated extra 6th bedroom and bathroom in the main villa that if required, you could use for example for your nanny/chef/teenage rascals etc- this can be arranged for a small fee as it doesn't actually come with the villa. This fee is 160 USD per night. (This final bedroom and bathroom are in no way as nice as the others but they can definitely provide a function if you need an extra Bunk Bed. Under the pictures it is called the bedroom 6 and bathroom 5)With this extra room, and the Studio, the whole property has 7 bedrooms- ) 5 of them ensuite.

Currently there are a couple of projects nearby which can be noisy - so please be careful booking. We’re delighted to host wonderful travelers who come to Bali to enjoy the island’s beauty and relax in our family villa. We put our heart into making this place welcoming and comfortable, and we’re proud that 99% of our guests have amazing experiences and leave us glowing reviews.However, if you’re someone who tends to be overly critical, extremely picky, or expects perfection down to the tiniest detail, this might not be the right fit for you. We’re a laid-back family villa, not a five-star hotel, and while we strive to provide a great experience, we understand that our homey atmosphere may not meet the high expectations of every guest.So, if you’re the kind of traveler who might be upset about a small crumb left in the fridge, a slight imperfection in the sheets, or a candle that isn’t replaced immediately, we kindly ask you to reconsider booking. (A 5 star hotel might be better for you :)In those rare cases where guests are persistently unhappy from the start, we prefer to offer a refund and part ways early to save everyone the stress. So please take this into account - we would actually prefer to not deal with complaining guests and not take their money so have a think if you are a very picky person or not. This is our private family home which we also rent out please understand this.We truly care about our guests and work hard to ensure you have a wonderful stay, but we’ve learned that it’s best for all parties if we’re on the same page from the beginning. Thank you for understanding, and we look forward to welcoming guests who appreciate the charm and comfort of a family-owned villa!In other news…The villa has an amazing sunset deck, with a fire pit. From this deck you can see the ocean in the distance - we do not call ourselves “ amazing ocean view\" because that would be misleading - however you can see the ocean in the distance and it is quite pretty.  We also have a private staircase that leads from our garage down to the beach which is about a three minute walk. We have purposely not put railings around the sunset deck to keep the aesthetic of the deck so kids should be careful but we have put plant pots around to maintain some level of safety . Enjoy it all but my suggestion is to keep an eye on the kids if they are on the deck.As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce our environmental impact and enhance guest comfort, we’ve recently upgraded our pool to a refreshing saltwater system — kinder to your skin and better for the planet. We’ve also installed a state-of-the-art multimedia water filtration system throughout the property, which helps remove common contaminants like chlorine, heavy metals, and odors — making showers and swims feel cleaner, softer, and more skin-friendly. While the water isn't drinkable, guests often notice benefits like smoother skin and softer hair. On top of that, we’ve swapped in eco-friendly tissue paper in all bathrooms and are gradually integrating more thoughtful, low-impact touches throughout the villa. 🌿We also provide Keren Water for drinking — a premium, locally trusted brand known for its clean, pure taste and high filtration standards. The bottles are BPA-free and made from PET, a safe and recyclable plastic often used for food-grade containers. It’s a small touch that many guests appreciate, especially in Bali’s climate, and reflects our commitment to offering healthier, more sustainable choices throughout your stay.Please note that the owners cannot take responsibility for any accidents that may occur during your stay — so we kindly ask that you take care, just as you would anywhere else.WA is required for all communication after the booking is confirmed- we have a well oiled system that uses WA groups. This is a requirement to ensure a smooth stay for you. On the WA group will be the Villa manager and the staff. Finally, occasionally venues near us host weddings and there can be music until midnight on these special nights -  but it’s reasonably rare that it’s loud and we do have acoustic doors and windows but just a little heads up:)The property comes with daily housekeeping and daily breakfast included. Our staff are available for you generally between 8am to 7pm. Please only contact the staff outside of these hours if it’s an emergency.We also have a sixth extra bedroom and bathroom which can be hired for an additional fee if you wish to bring your nanny/chef/trainer etc or even use it for kids. It’s not in any way like the other bedrooms but it can definitely sleep two people comfortably in a bunkbed. Fee is 2.5 mio IDR per night (around 160 USD)We also accept card payments at the villa for any additional expenses during your stay — such as meals, transport, or extra services. All major cards are welcome, except American Express.We look forward to hosting you and ensuring your stay is as enjoyable as possible. Feel free to reach out with any questions.If you have read this far I’m very impressed thank you !(Below are more details about the bed room set up)ROOM SET UP (4/5 rooms)Summer Ulu Main HouseTOP FLOOR - (all size in cm)1.

Work typically happens Monday–Saturday, between 9:00–12:00 and 13:00–17:00 (with a break from 12:00-13:00). Sundays are completely quiet.Noise levels can vary, some days may be surprisingly peaceful and others might be louder due to heavy machinery like excavators. Because of this, we've already applied a 50% discount to your stay to reflect the potential disruption.Please book at your own risk, especially if you’re highly sensitive to noise or are looking for a totally serene daytime experience. We want to make sure your expectations are aligned before arrival.One thing we want to avoid is anyone having a bad holiday due to unexpected construction, so please keep this in mind when booking. We're also happy to discuss further discounts if needed.We look forward to hosting you :)Many thanks,Summer Ulu🌴",

  "title": "Rumah Purnama - Enchanting 3 bedroom villa in Ubud",
  "description": "Rumah Purnama is a heritage Balinese wantilan home that was fully restored and renovated by Studio Jencquel, to encompass the luxuries of modernity while retaining the charm of Bali’s bohemian heyday. In the shade of the centennial coconut trees and under a wood shingled roof, this charming 3-bedroom home boasts spectacular jungle and moonrise views across the sacred Campuhan Ridge.The spaceEntering the hillside home on the main floor of the pagoda-like wantilan through a tamarind-wood front door of bleached chocolate hues, one is greeted by the friendly smiles of elongated, Giacometti-esque, ironwood statuettes sourced from the island of Kalimantan in Borneo. This welcoming entrance hall is a transitional space acting as a mediator between the main living room, the dining room, the kitchen, the guest room, the powder room, and the staircase that leads to the first floor. The color palette is natural, earthen, and simple; leaving plenty of room for the creativity and color of the mind. The natural hardwoods, alang-alang grass, earthen wall coloring, and off-white linens and marbles create a calm, grounded feeling — as if one is finally home, even if they have never been there before until now. All functions of the house are laid out under one roof, allowing for comfortable access to all rooms and spaces on both floors, even in the most tropical of rains. Entrance HallCozy and welcoming, this all-access point for the rest of the home is tastefully decorated with a soft area rug and a unique Buddha sculpture, sitting lotus in meditation. Behind a small Balinese door sits a conveniently located powder room. Through wood-framed glass doors ahead, a view of the pool and the jungle beyond can be seen past the living and dining areas. Living & Dining RoomThe spacious open-air living and dining room share a 35m2 area with a terrazzo floor, just steps from the pool, and surrounded by stunning vistas.The living area hosts a plush three-seater sofa covered in imported Italian linen, next to a large, stylish coffee table constructed from teak and local marble. Nearby, a Venezuelan hammock beckons for lazy hours spent reading a good book or perhaps generating inspiration.The dining table and comfortable chairs, designed by Studio Jencquel, beckon up to 10 to sit for a feast of the senses and the appetite. Over the elongated bench-style seating on one side of the table, and above the sofa nearby, hang Maximilian Jencquel’s ​Forest-Storm​ paintings and carefully selected artworks. Three rattan chandeliers over the table’s center provide soft, delectable illumination by night.Pool & DeckSteps away are the infinity pool and deck, waiting to be enjoyed day or night for a cooling plunge; or for taking in the breathtaking scenery that abounds. The shimmering pool, a compact 3m x 8m, is a study in pleasurable contrasts — infinite yet snug, and grounded to the earth yet with a feeling of floating above the jungle below.The ironwood deck and outdoor lounging area are perfect for a sunbath, and to enjoy an early cup of heart-warming Balinese ginger tea while admiring the majestic views of Gunung Agung further to the Northeast. Perhaps the ideal use of this lovely space is to watch magnificent full moon rises over the horizon to the East — a magical moment that captures the strong energies of Campuhan Ridge that captivated Walter Spies so long ago.The deck is bookended by ancient Balinese family temple structures, kept here with respect for the land and its heritage; with gratitude for its beauty and abundance — and still blessed with daily ceremonies to this day.KitchenThe fully equipped modern kitchen is adjacent to the entrance hall, in the perfect location to create a “homey” environment with delectable cooking scents. Ready for you to prepare everything from an Indonesian ​nasi campur​ to a New York pizza, this cozy 9m2 space feels much more spacious than its actual size.The kitchen is supplied with a high-quality induction cooktop and oven from Germany. It includes all the appliances and conveniences needed to cook a meal for ten or a late-night nosh for one to an abundant meal for a family.Bedroom - MeierOn the opposite side of the entrance hall from the kitchen is the well-appointed ground floor guest bedroom, with floors of local beige-colored terrazzo. Measuring 17m2, it hosts window bays facing East and South, boasting scenic views towards the swimming pool and beyond, as well as onto the nearby Balinese family temple. The room comfortably fits a plush king-sized bed with a high-quality King Koil mattress and pure cotton sheets, and a good night’s rest is ensured with air-conditioning and fitted mosquito netting. An open wardrobe with plenty of storage provides a home for clothes, suitcases, and other items needing safe harbor.The en suite bath is 14m2 and comes with a bathtub for soothing soaks, and also has an indoor shower with built-in skylight. Overall, this bedroom is a perfect blend of comfort and luxury that also suits it for use as a master boudoir, or perhaps as a cozy nest for the visiting in-laws.The Rooms - UpstairsFamily RoomFrom the entrance hall, stairs going up lead directly into the family room, where the ​Bangkirai timber-clad walls and floors create a cozy cabin feel. Hanging art of wooden paddles accentuate the almost maritime sense of the proceedings. A soft three-seater sofa of imported Italian linen rests opposite to a 55” television. Even with its size of 20m2, the family room embodies a mood of cocooning with loved ones for an evening enjoying fine cinema or bingeing favorite shows. For comfort and cooling, a ceiling fan and air conditioning are thoughtfully provided.Bedroom - MeadThis finely furnished guest bedroom comes with something unique for this locale — a partial ocean view. The window bays face East and South, and on clear days the Indian Ocean can be perceived on the far horizon. Low panoramic windows allow unobstructed views directly from the bed, and ships may sometimes be observed passing in the distance.The bedroom hosts timber-clad walls, and a 22m2 ​Bangkirai ​timber floor surface, partially covered with a natural carpet from Sumatra. It is comfortably appointed with a king-sized bed and luxury King Koil mattress, pure cotton sheets, and a fitted mosquito net. There’s also air-conditioning and a ceiling fan for cooling — but you may need neither, as true sea breezes are known to blow through. A fine working desk and chair facing towards the beautiful scenery gives one a place to sort their inspirations into artistic statements like a modern-day Walter Spies.The 14m2 full en suite bathroom is partially outdoors, and features an open-air shower that enjoys amazing 360° views of the surrounding nature — while continuing to preserve one’s privacy.Main Bedroom - ChaplinThe main bedroom has timber-clad walls, a generous surface of 32m2. The room’s ​Bangkirai ​timber floors are partially covered with soft natural carpeting from Sumatra. Window bays facing East and North offer a partial view of Gunung Agung, perceived behind the rolling hills on clear days. Low panoramic windows allow unobstructed views of Campuhan Ridge directly from the plush super-sized bed.Fitted mosquito netting, air conditioning, and a ceiling fan ensure comfort and sound sleep, and sea breezes are known to waft through the windows when the winds are just right. A lounging chair makes an ideal spot for reading, sketching, or other pursuits of the mind. The full height mirror will keep you looking sharp before heading out on the town.The 19m2 en suite bathroom is partially outdoors, and includes high-end Japanese washlet toilet and plenty of storage in the marble vanity. An amazing open-air shower has 360° views of the green hills and jungle around you, while retaining privacy. Adjacent to the shower, an unusual treat — a sweet guava tree with wonderfully scented and delicious fruit. In keeping with the heritage of the area, there are cheerful sculptures made from Wos River stones by a local artisan that represent his childhood — a time when we all naturally embrace our inner artist without reservation.Guest accessEntire houseOther things to noteNeighborhood Please be aware that the neighboring property is currently undergoing renovation work, which may result in occasional noise disturbances. You may hear sounds of hammering and sawing at varying levels of intensity.To account for any potential disruptions, we have already adjusted our rates accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.——————Private cookOur private cook is available for Rumah Purnama, for lunch and dinner (on most days with prior notice), at the cost of the groceries + 20%. Please leave some notice of what you wish to eat, since we always try to source local and conscious products - our meals are prepared with fresh ingredients following the seasons and rhythm of the local markets. We do not offer a la carte. Please ask for our menu for choices and inspiration.",

  "title": "Breathtaking Ocean Edge Views From Exceptional Luxury Villa",
  "description": "The Luxe Bali is the benchmark for ultra high end villas in Bali.Location, Facility, Comfort and Service have never been matched as completely and seamlessly as in this villa which functions more along the lines of a super yacht than the often touted  luxury residence.The spaceTo ensure you will have the best holiday possible regardless of where you book, please read our advice here.The Luxe Bali is not in anyway your average 'luxury villa', a term perhaps a little to generously used online.  If you are here then you are spending a reasonable amount of money for a vacation,  please be as informed as possible of what you are getting here and more to the point what you will be and not be getting elsewhere for that money. If you have already experienced the quaint rustic or the all visual flash but not real quality , or located on the cliffs with an extremely long and steep walk  to reach the ocean way below villa experiences and would now like to experience a beyond first class residence in comfortable  location, facility and service that you would absolutely love to live in for the rest of your life then this is the villa for you. A true blend of the finest elements the west and east can put together. Most lean too much either way, The Luxe Bali has found that perfect harmonious middle point between fine finish natural materials and absolute high-end comfort.  Understated ZEN.  Unlike most villas on the island The Luxe Bali is unique in that it was built with an totally unlimited budget by a very high net worth individual as a second home, one the owner wanted to be as beautiful, comfortable, and facilitated as possible. Not spending as much time in Bali these days the owner has put the villa up for selected rental when they are not there. A nine-year build by the finest craftsmen from all over the world, this is the time it took to get everything to the meticulous quality standards the owner desired. The Architect of the world famous KuDeTa Restaurant in Seminyak was selected to design the villa.    There are some villas around with more bedrooms for larger groups  but more luxurious ?  we have yet to see any that have taken it to the level of our residence.  Most villas loudly promoted in the ‘luxury' category would be lucky to qualify as low end  airline business class equivalents, whereas The Luxe Bali is without any doubt up there with the finest airlines first class offerings and at a fraction of what those flights cost.  The 1200 m2 (13,000 ft2) of living space boasts Four Master Suites with their own lounge area and en suite bathroom containing separate shower and bath space, with each having private terrace or direct access opening to the cliff edge pool. The fourth floor Penthouse Suite features a stunning 88 m2  (950 ft2) of open marble terrace, one of the premier spots in Bali from where you can see the cliffs running down the coast, the surf right out front of you, and the distant shores of Kuta, Seminyak and Canggu across the vast ocean bay and also to enjoy the spectacular light show every sunset brings.  Beside this in the evening there no black void looking into the dark ocean abyss when the sun goes down as the twinkling lights of the Kuta - Seminyak shoreline can be seen across the bay. The King-size Beds strategically placed to catch the views have the most comfortable absolute top end mattresses available; high thread count cotton sheets and a variety of hardness non-allergic microfiber pillows.    The third floor feature two grand bedroom suites with stunning ensuite bathrooms with separate showers and baths and outside terraces, these are the OceanView Suite and the Rainforest Suite.The second floor is the living dining upper ground level. It contains several lounge areas, family tv area, a grand dining area , a celebrity kitchen using absolute top shelf appliances with a master chef and butler included. This floor at one end leads to a beautiful rainforest grove complete with two large banyan trees, a multitude of ferns, palms, waterfalls and koi ponds, the other end of the second floor is an unrestricted view of the ocean with cliffs running down to Balangan Beach. Stand at the edge of the lawn and watch the surfers paddling by. The Cliff Edge Pool Suite is located on the lower ground floor and contains either two single beds or a king size double bed (as requested), and spacious private lounge space that opens out directly onto the large cliff edge pool, pergola and gardens. The fourth bedroom has a bathroom with a luxurious high flow shower (no bath) and when desired this suite can be locked from the rest of the villa  to be a self contained apartment with it's own private entrance. This space is perfect for  high end clients that travel with an assistant and desire them to be close by but not too close. The  lower ground level also holds the fun zone , with a gym, a dry redwood cedar sauna, a steam room, massage spa, and dedicated home theatre.  The Meals. The very talented Chef prepares meals of the highest standard of quality and flavour. Many guests come with the intention of eating out at the high end restaurants Bali is so well know for, but after experiencing the quality of the in-house chef prepared meals served by your own butler and waiter, they often forgo the visits to other restaurants. Guests are charged a 20% surcharge for groceries and produce and the chef prepares meals from that.  The cost saving for meals alone becomes quite significant. Please Read the guest reviews about the meals. The same with Drinks, the villa does not sell drinks, but rather authentic origin bottles of wines and spirits are purchased at a 20% surcharge and the butler with a significant saving for you mixes cocktails. The property was purchased well before most any other property on the southern peninsular at a time when they had the choice and means to buy anywhere and sat on for a decade while planning the grounds.  Being already well informed on building locations and sun orientation they noticed two significant features almost no other site on the coastline provided.  Firstly the property actually faces north across the ocean with Mt Agung and the other volcanoes of Bali in the distant background. What this aspect means is a significantly cooler space where you get ocean views all day long without the intense and often uncomfortable heat of the sun beaming into and heating up your villa, and secondly this site is one of less than a handful with terraced grounds all the way down to just above the waters edge.  Once again, this is not a villa built on a normal business budget as a as an upmarket hotel might; they often are the obvious ones all bundled together like cookie cutter suburbs.  This is a unique high net worth owners villa in a very private gated estate of only three properties all built and owned by three high net worth individuals. No look after 70 villa  management companies, no built by a developer or commercial operation  and the significantly lower quality build, fixtures and infrastructure one will undoubtedly get from such a set up, rather a truly unique villa of the highest order in a unique setting. Please read our guest comments, you will see by glowing reviews how much previous guests have appreciated what they experienced and how much they enjoyed their stay.  You really owe it to yourself. The Prices are for a rental of all Four (4) bedrooms.  with up to 8 Adults and 3 children A 3 Bedroom option for up to 6 Adults and 2 children  ,  a 2 Bedroom option for up to 4 Adults  (or 2 adults 2 children ), and a 1 Bedroom option for  up to 2 Adults are available Any numbers outside of these please message me so we can work something out.  To find these offerings above please go to my Hanny the host page and select the villa with the number of bedrooms you need or message me and I will provide you with the right option.Warm Regards HannyGuest accessYou are overlooking with direct ocean frontage the Surf of Padang Padang Beach. Watch surfers on the waves right below you. The Indian Ocean is at the end of your private terraced garden path, and at low tide you can step straight onto the sand of Padang Padang Beach.

  "title": "Luxury 5 Bedroom Cliff Ocean Edge Villa Uluwatu",
  "description": "The Luxe Bali is an ultra high end 4 floor  5 bedroom luxury villa above Padang Padang Beach - Uluwatu in a small gated estate. Enjoy cliff edge views of the surf break and beach below with a pathway to the oceans edge.  It features a 4 floor lift, gym, spa, sauna, steam room, home theatre, butler, master chef, housekeeping, 4 pools, & lush gardens. The separate 'Honeymoon' 5th Bedroom is a cosy villa  located just above the waters edge against the cliff face with it's own private plunge pool.The spaceThe Luxe Bali is not your average 'luxury villa'.  If you are here then you are spending a lot of money for a vacation,  please be as informed as possible of what you are getting. If you have already experienced the quaint rustic or the all flash not real quality located on the cliffs/  pool with the long walk getting to the ocean way below villa experiences and would now like to experience a beyond first class residence in location, facility and service that you would absolutely love to live in for the rest of your life then this is the villa for you. A true blend of the finest elements the west and east can put together. Most lean to much either way, The Luxe Bali has found that perfect harmonious middle point between rustic natural materials and absolute high-end comfort.  Understated ZEN. Unlike most villas on the island The Luxe Bali is unique in that it was built with an totally unlimited budget by a very high net worth individual as a second home, one the owner wanted to be as beautiful, comfortable, and facilitated as possible. Not spending as much time in Bali these days the owner has put the villa up for selected rental when they are not there. A nine-year build by the finest craftsmen from all over the world, this is the time it took to get everything to the meticulous quality standards the owner desired. The Architect of the world famous KuDeTa Restaurant in Seminyak was selected to design the villa. There are villas around with more bedrooms for larger groups with some housing an entire football team, but more luxurious? we have yet to see any that have taken it to the level of this residence. Most villas loudly promoted in the ‘luxury' category would be lucky to qualify as bargain basement business class airline equivalents on cheaper airlines, whereas The Luxe Bali is without any doubt up there with the finest airlines first class offerings and at a fraction of what those flights cost. The (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ) of living space boasts Four Master Suites with their own lounge area and en suite bathroom, with each having private terrace or direct access opening to the cliff edge pool. The fourth floor Penthouse Suite features a stunning (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ) of open marble terrace, one of the premier spots in Bali from where you can see the cliffs running down the coast, the surf right out front of you, and the distant shores of Kuta, Seminyak and Canggu across the vast ocean bay and also to enjoy the spectacular light show every sunset brings. The King-size Beds strategically placed to catch the views have the most comfortable absolute top end mattresses available; high thread count cotton sheets and a variety of hardness non-allergic microfiber pillows. For the ultimate experience the world’s finest Frette Italian Bed sheets are available at extra surcharge.The fourth floor Penthouse Suite features a stunning (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ) of open marble terrace, definitely one of the premier spots in Bali from where you can see the cliffs running down the coast, the surf and surfers right out front of you, the distant shores of Kuta, Seminyak and Canggu across the vast ocean bay and the spectacular light show every sunset brings. Beside this in the evening there no black void into the abyss when the sun goes down and the twinkling lights of the Kuta - Seminyak shoreline along with local fishing boats creates an enchanted view.The third floor feature two spacious bedroom suites with stunning ensuite bathrooms and expansive outside terraces, these are the OceanView Suite and the Rainforest Suite.The second floor is the living dining upper ground level. It contains several lounge areas, a celebrity kitchen with a master chef and butler included. This floor at one end leads to a beautiful rainforest grove complete with two large banyan trees, a multitude of ferns, palms, waterfalls and koi ponds, the other end of the second floor is an unrestricted view of the ocean with cliffs running down to Balangan Beach. Stand at the edge of the lawn and talk to the surfers paddling by.The Cliff Edge Pool Suite is located on the lower ground floor and contains either two single beds or a king size double bed (as requested), and spacious private lounge space that opens out directly onto the large cliff edge pool, pergola and gardens. The fourth bedroom has a bathroom with a luxurious high flow shower (no bath).The lower ground level also holds the fun zone , with a gym, a dry redwood cedar sauna, a steam room, massage spa, and dedicated home theatre. The Meals. Our very talented Chef prepares meals of the highest standard of quality and flavour. Many guests come with the intention of eating out at the high end restaurants Bali is so well know for, but after experiencing the quality of the in-house chef prepared meals served by your own butler and waiter, they often forgo the visits to other restaurants. Guests are charged a 20% surcharge for groceries and produce and the chef prepares meals from that. The cost saving for meals alone becomes quite significant. Please Read the guest reviews about the meals. The same with Drinks, the villa does not sell drinks, but rather authentic origin bottles of wines and spirits are purchased at a 20% surcharge and the butler with a significant saving for you mixes cocktails.The property was purchased well before most any other property on the southern peninsular at a time when they had the choice and means to buy anywhere. This unique location was first noted back in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) after the owners of the estate was surfing an unknown Padang Padang perfect shape left hand tube. Being already well informed on building locations and sun orientation they noticed two significant features almost no other site on the coastline provided. Firstly the property faces north across the ocean with Mt Agung in the background, what this means is a significantly cooler space where you get ocean views all day long without the intense and often uncomfortable heat of the sun beaming into and heating up your villa, and secondly this site is one of less than a handful with terraced grounds all the way down to just above the waters edge.The property was purchased well before most any other property on the southern peninsular at a time when they had the choice and means to buy anywhere. Once again, this is not a villa built on a the normal budget as a business; they are the obvious ones all bundled together . This is a unique high net worth owners villa in a private gated estate of only three properties all built and owned by three high net worth individuals. No management companies, no built then sold by a developer or middleman and the lower quality fixtures and infrastructure they would undoubtedly get from such a set up.Please read our guest comments, you will see by glowing reviews how much previous guests have appreciated what they experienced and how much they enjoyed their stay.

As they are working on their land, this is just natural and we can't do anything against it. Take it as an opportunity to see more of the locals life!VILLA WITH RICE FIELD VIEWAs nature is integral to the villa, you may hear noises which come from insects and animals who inhabit the rice field and surroundings (frogs, chickens etc.). This is the charm of living close to nature in Bali.Kindly note that rice fields surrounding the property are the main food resources for locals living in the area. This means they may be harvested at different times of the year. Host is not responsible for any surrounding landscape modification/intervention out of their scope.Bali is a humid and tropical natural environment with lots of greenery. Geckos, insects and other exotic animals from time to time (bats, lizards, bugs…) are endemic to the Island. Even though gentle pest controls are regularly operated at the property, some encounters may occur. Please note that all of them are completely harmless and important for a balanced ecosystem. Since the property is located in a newly developed area, the electricity supply may not be as reliable as in more developed cities. Occasional power cuts from the island’s unique provider are to be expected. Please note that these situations are entirely beyond the host's control. There is no generator on-site, and refunds will not be provided for this reason.===FAQs- Q: What time is the Check-in policy?-A: Please be informed that check-in time is at 15:00 by default.

  "title": "Amazing 9 Bedroom Heart of Seminyak-Oberoi",
  "description": "The Villa sits on 1800sqm of landscaped gardens just 300m from Seminyak’s best beach, featuring 9 bedroom Villa. The Villa, right in the heart of prestigious Oberoi district, is only 300 meters from Ku De Ta and can comfortably accommodate up to 18 guests.The spaceThe villa consist of a 6 bedroom and 4 bedroom connected villa, both feature L shaped, signature swimming pools, huge living rooms, indoor and outdoor lounging and dining, pool tables, vast individual bedroom suites, world-class interior design with a distinct Balinese theme, and every conceivable luxury for the sophisticated holidaymaker. We will lock one of the bedroom during your stay.The villa has unrivalled facilities with 15 full-time staff, including a private butler for each villa, chefs, housekeeping, gardener and trained security, plus on-demand chauffeurs, spa therapists and concierge, all of whom are dedicated to ensuring guests are pampered during every moment of their stay, except of course when they hang out the red ‘do not disturb’ flag to ensure total privacy.Guest accessIndoor livingThe vast open-sided and open-plan living areas that spread across the garden levels of the two pavilions form the social hubs of the villa. These are spectacular spaces for relaxing and entertaining, defined by soaring teakwood columns and skillfully divided into separate activity areas, with the swimming pools edging almost into the rooms. On one side, conversation is sure to flow with the configuration of oversized sofas arranged around huge coffee tables, set before bars with stools, drinks fridges and glass jars full of snacks. With an equally social focus, full-size billiard tables are centrally located. Opposite, comfortable sofas and armchairs are grouped around 52, 46 and 40 inch flat-screen satellite TVs and home entertainment systems.The dining areas are equally generous. The 6 bedroom side of the estate offers an enormous slab of teakwood fashioned into a statement dining table seating 20 people, with room to spare. A smaller, but equally attractive table is provided on the 4 bedroom side. Behind an island buffet of black granite, are guest kitchens, which are well equipped with American-style fridges, hobs, ovens, microwaves and an extensive collection of plates and utensils housed in handsome wooden cupboards. Doors from these areas lead to the 'back of house' section, with separate staff kitchen allowing for extra guest privacy whilst the resident chefs are preparing meals.Outdoor livingThe villa offers a wide range of outdoor living areas in keeping with the same highly social space planning that define its interiors. The 12m and 14m swimming pools, with water-feature on the boundary walls and wide shallow steps leading towards the living areas, are the perfect spots to cool off, while ironwood decks with stylish sun loungers shaded by beautiful parasols provide ideal settings for alfresco siestas or refreshing sundowners.The many terraces and decks at both levels of all three pavilions provide opportunities for private relaxation while enjoying views of the beautifully landscaped gardens, with an old Cambodia frangipani, a sacred Pohon Pile tree and Sawit date palms that have been specially imported from Java.Other things to noteGuests who wish to enjoy home cooking in the privacy of the Villa will appreciate the resident full time chef who will happily prepare a wide range of Balinese, Asian and international dishes.Food and beverage chargesAll provisions can be purchased by our housekeepers and charged to guests at cost price. Shopping receipts will be provided either daily or at the end of the stay – at your option.  It is requested that our staff be given a ‘float’ to cover the grocery shopping.Wine, beer, spirits and soft drinks are also available upon request and an account will be presented for settlement at the end of your stay.StaffGuests of the villa are looked after, with great attention to detail, by a dedicated team of professionals drawn from the local community, under the direction of our villa manager. Our staff are trained to anticipate their guests’ every whim with typical Balinese charm and a ready smile. They are very much part of the villa experience.Villa manager\tOur villa manager is responsible for the overall operation of the villa, including staffing and guest satisfaction. Fluent in English, she warmly familiarizes guests with the villa on arrival and is only a phone call away should you have any special requests.Chef\tThe resident full time chef is skilled at cooking a wide array of international and Indonesian cuisine.Housekeepers\tA team of seven housekeepers takes care of cleaning and tidying the villa in shifts from 7am to 11pm. They also prepare breakfast and can shop for groceries if required.Gardener/pool attendant\tA gardener discreetly tends to the pools and gardens every day.Spa therapists\tFully trained spa therapists will visit the villa upon request to provide massages and other spa treatments on guest account.Security\tNight-time security is provided by trained staff.SpaFeel like a body scrub or massage? Just ask our staff to bring the spa to you! We can recommend deluxe treatments carried out in the privacy of the villa – be it by the pool, on the terrace or in the cool of the bedroom – by fully trained therapists from a reputable local spa (extra charges will apply). Here’s a sample of what’s on the menu:Balinese massageRelease built up tension with a traditional Balinese massage. Using a combination of gentle stretches, acupressure and aromatherapy oils to stimulate the flow of blood, oxygen and energy around your body, you will feel totally relaxed in no time.Foot reflexologyFoot reflexology is a natural healing art based on the principle that there are reflexes in the feet which correspond to every part of the body. Through application of pressure on these reflexes tension is relieved and circulation improved leaving you feeling balanced.Body scrubA full body scrub will exfoliate and hydrate your skin leaving it soft and smooth. A rejuvenating scrub combines an abrasive material such as salt, coffee, rice bran or pecan hulls with essential oils to remove any impurities and make your skin glow.Manicure/pedicureOur hands and feet work hard for us every day but rarely get the attention they deserve. Treat them to a manicure or pedicure, which usually comes with the added bonus of a quick hand or foot massage.FamiliesThe family-friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many and varied, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is real plus – and ensures that parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday.The villa is ideal for families. Younger children can be easily supervised in the pools, as they are visible from all areas of the open-plan living room, and will enjoy watching TV in the living areas or the second floor media room. Older kids will gravitate to the billiard tables, appreciate the size and privacy of the bedrooms, and revel in the chance to wander out safely to the beach, shops and nightlife of Seminyak.Our friendly staff will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost). Although well equipped kitchens allow you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest.Nor do you have to worry about packing all that cumbersome extra equipment. When you stay at the villa, we can provide you with all the essentials. We have a cot and high chair, and anything we don’t have in-house, we can generally hire for a small fee. Just talk through your requirements with us when you make your reservation and we’ll make sure it’s all ready and waiting for your arrival.We are required by local regulations to charge occupancy tax. Villa rate is subject to 15,5% government taxes and services charge, not included in the price of the reservation and have to be paid directly upon check-in.

Four great locations for weddings including by the pool, river, forest and indoor joglo.For retreats there are 2 yoga shalas and a kitchen that is trained to cater for all dietary requirements.Other things to noteRecent review from Trip Advisor: “Best friends wedding venue”We spent almost a week here for my best friends wedding in June. My boyfriend had never been to Bali, but as soon as we got to the Villas, he was blown away! The wedding organiser Palani was so attentive and responsive to my friend and the wedding party and all the associated family and friends. We had the most incredible time and we will be back for sure!! The scenery is trye Balinese jungle and the pools are all glorious! The photos don't do justice to the actual environment.The only down side was that the aircon was fine for day to day use, but when trying to get ready in wedding and bridesmaid dresses, it was hard to find a room that was cool enough, but I guess that's what you get for getting married in Bali. Also, expect a bit of a wait for taxis to get in and out, as your out of ubud, you have to wait for them to get to you. Such minor elements to a phenomenal place!",

Each of the 5 bedrooms has a view of the ocean plus a terrace or outdoor patio. Enjoy the direct beach access, the pool overlooking the waves, and the unique walk-through grotto. The secluded location, by the surfing village of Balian, ensures total privacy.  Our staff of 10 will make sure a holiday at The Cove will be one of pure relaxation.The spaceThe Cove Bali is an absolute beachfront, fully serviced 5-bedroom villa in the surfing village of Balian (West Bali). It has amazing views over the Indian Ocean and is built mainly in reclaimed teak wood and local stone.

Overlooking the beach, a beautiful 13 meter swimming pool is the perfect place to cool off and take in the view. There is also a regulation size grass tennis court, nestled among coconut trees. The house is spacious yet cozy, and the property is so big (7,000 square meters) that at any time guests can feel they have all the privacy and space they wish for.Guest accessGuests will enjoy the beach, a wonderful sunset cabana, a 13-meter infinity pool overlooking the waves, 5 spacious bedrooms (each with balconies or terraces overlooking the ocean,) beautiful bathrooms in stone and wood, a private tennis court, a private chef who can cook fantastic Indonesian and European food, as well as vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free; friendly and professional housekeepers and lots of private space.Other things to noteThe Cove is an idyllic place: the food is amazing, the views are incredible, the pool is spectacular.

  "description": "This 4 bedroom villa can also be converted into 5 bedroom villa and can accommodate up to 10 people. Located in the beautiful village of Kelusa, Payangan just 15 minutes north of Ubud. This villa have 2 infinity pool and it is surrounded by amazing view of rice paddy fields, streams, rivers, jungles and mountains at the distance. It is indeed a relaxing place to stay.The spaceVilla Kelusa is a bewitching, four-building compound on an isolated 3.1 hectares in the true, vibrant, beating heart of Bali.At jungle’s edge, atop a vast amphitheatre of rice paddies cascading down into the deep gorge of the holy Pakuseba River, and with a panoramic view of a distant ridge of nine ancient volcanoes, the lovely and ultra-private Villa Kelusa is nestled in the Balinese foothills beneath the very small, traditional village of Kelusa.While practically untouched by the modern world, Kelusa is also a surprisingly few minutes drive down the hill to Ubud, a very large, bustling village which, with its world-renowned restaurants, dance performances, art galleries and nearby 5-star hotels, is considered to be the cultural center of Bali.Villa Kelusa blends together two properties, Pondok Sapi (the Shed of the Cow) and Pondok Surya (Sunset House), which can be rented separately or together. All bedrooms, as well as living and dining areas, have breathtaking views.To the north, Pondok Sapi is named after the ubiquitous thatched cow sheds which dot the jungles and also shelter the farmers in their rice terraces, and was designed as the private residence of a retired American writer and television journalist. Three separate buildings make up Pondok Sapi: a glass studio with two spacious in-suite master bedrooms and a library; a large open-air living pavilion with gourmet kitchen and a media room which can be converted into a third luxury bedroom; and a private entertainment cabana with infinity pool and lounge area.Pondok Surya, or Sunset House, was also designed with open, panoramic views of the rice paddies, jungle and mountains. It has a large, second story in-suite master bedroom with a wrap-around terrace, guest bedroom and smaller kitchen. There is also another infinity pool which runs through the house, separating the living and entertainment areas.In short:If you’re seeking the real Bali, the enchanted Bali, the Bali so loved by musicologist Colin McPhee (author of “A House in Bali”), Charlie Chaplin, and the artists Antonio Blanco and Walter Spies…Villa Kelusa is beckoning you.Guest accessWhen you rent this property, you will have the access to the whole area of the property that you rent. No one would be around, it will be the total privacy of yours.",

  "title": "Svasti Soka - Bamboo Stay in Bali's Highlands",
  "description": "Discover Svasti Soka, a unique bamboo villa surrounded by the breathtaking rice terraces of Jatiluwih, a UNESCO World Heritage site. This eco-friendly retreat blends modern comfort with traditional design, offering a peaceful escape in the heart of Bali’s highlands. Wake up to fresh mountain air, stunning sunrise views, and the sound of nature—perfect for couples, adventurers, and anyone seeking serenity.The spaceNestled in the heart of Jatiluwih’s serene landscape, this bamboo villa offers the perfect harmony between natural architecture and the authentic beauty of Bali’s countryside. Surrounded by mesmerizing terraced rice fields, the atmosphere is peaceful—accompanied only by the gentle sound of flowing water and the evening song of crickets.Built entirely from selected bamboo, the villa is eco-friendly, blending seamlessly with nature while offering a simple yet luxurious living experience. From the terrace, guests can witness the sunrise slowly lifting the morning mist, or the golden sunset reflecting across the rice paddies.However, this natural beauty comes with its own balance. Due to its open setting, guests may experience the dynamic tropical weather—occasional heavy rain, cool damp nights, or small field insects wandering into open spaces. If you are not someone who likes something new with an open nature concept where there is a possibility of meeting living creatures around active rice fields, we warn you NOT TO STAY HERE.Still, these small inconveniences are outweighed by the profound experience it offers: true peace, fresh air, and a direct connection to nature that has become increasingly rare. This villa is more than a place to stay—it is a journey to rediscover tranquility and the simplicity of life.Other things to noteFAQ1.

Our policy is the same as Airbnb general rule: You must leave our place exactly as you find it.  Everything in the villa that you use, including towels, sheets, plates, glasses etc. and the building as a whole, must be treated as if it were your own.  Our towels will be given to you in a white, clean state and we expect them to be left the same.  Damage will be claimed for through Airbnb host protection if you do not do so, so please make sure that all members of your group are aware of this before check in.  Do not use our towels or our pillow cases to remove makeup or sunscreen.  Ruined sheets cost $100USD each per sheet and towels, $40USD each.   2. There will be few staff members sleeping onsite including security 24/7 (at the rear of the staff kitchen area), so it won't suit you if you want complete privacy.   This staff member is responsible for cleaning the garden on a twice daily basis.  Staff will also be in the communal area to clean and feed the fish and turtles twice each day.3. Only the number of guests listed in the original booking will be allowed on the premises - you may not invite other guests into the villa at any time without the owners' expressed permission or or agreed with owner prior to check in for guest changing schedule.4. This villa is totally unsuited to parties - the neighbourhood is quiet and loud music and/or parties will not be tolerated.5.  The villa does not have a backup generator so in the somewhat rare event that power is lost in the area, we will also be without power too until PLN have it fixed.6. CHECK OUT TIME IS STRICTLY 11AM; all guests will be asked to vacate the premises at 11am sharp so we have time to prepare for incoming guests.  If you cannot comply with that check out time and wish to stay longer, you must book an extra night.    Our place is large and we need the time to prepare for incoming guests.Please also read 'other details to note' before booking.Guest accessWe have provided parking for two cars and approximately 12 motorbikes.  You will be able to walk to Bingin Beach stairs in just a few minutes (it's less than 300 meters).Other things to noteThere are elements of the building (such as the staircase with no handrail and an unfenced pool) that are NOT child-friendly.  However children are welcome at your own risk for safety.  Supervision of children at all times is essential.  Our fish and turtle pond is not for little (or big) hands to interfere with the creatures within and there is a large Oscar fish who WILL bite dangling digits and he has a mouth full of teeth!  There is no backup generator so in the event of an area power cut we will also be without power for the duration.We do NOT allow sub-letting of our place; if you are intending to book our villa with a view to selling rooms (i.e. hosting a retreat), you must ask permission first by sending a message.",

  "title": "Luxury 2 Bedroom Cliff Ocean Edge Villa Uluwatu",
  "description": "The Luxe Bali is an ultra high end 4 floor family and couples friendly 2 bedroom luxury villa right above Padang Padang Beach Uluwatu in an exclusive 3 villa gated estateEnjoy private cliff edge views of the surf break and beach below with a private  pathway to the ocean's edge4 floor lift, gym, spa, sauna, steam room, home theatre, butler, master chef, housekeeping, 3 pools, lush gardens and fine art are but a few of it's unique qualitiesThe spaceTo ensure you will have the best holiday possible regardless of where you book, please read our advice here.The Luxe Bali is not in anyway your average 'luxury villa', a term perhaps a little to generously used online.  If you are here then you are spending a reasonable amount of money for a vacation,  please be as informed as possible of what you are getting here and more to the point what you will be and not be getting elsewhere for that money. If you have already experienced the quaint rustic or the all visual flash but not real quality , or located on the cliffs with an extremely long and steep walk  to reach the ocean way below villa experiences and would now like to experience a beyond first class residence in comfortable  location, facility and service that you would absolutely love to live in for the rest of your life then this is the villa for you. A true blend of the finest elements the west and east can put together. Most lean too much either way, The Luxe Bali has found that perfect harmonious middle point between fine finish natural materials and absolute high-end comfort.  Understated ZEN.  Unlike most villas on the island The Luxe Bali is unique in that it was built with an totally unlimited budget by a very high net worth individual as a second home, one the owner wanted to be as beautiful, comfortable, and facilitated as possible. Not spending as much time in Bali these days the owner has put the villa up for selected rental when they are not there. A nine-year build by the finest craftsmen from all over the world, this is the time it took to get everything to the meticulous quality standards the owner desired. The Architect of the world famous KuDeTa Restaurant in Seminyak was selected to design the villa.    There are some villas around with more bedrooms for larger groups  but more luxurious ?  we have yet to see any that have taken it to the level of our residence.  Most villas loudly promoted in the ‘luxury' category would be lucky to qualify as low end  airline business class equivalents, whereas The Luxe Bali is without any doubt up there with the finest airlines first class offerings and at a fraction of what those flights cost.  The 1200 m2 (13,000 ft2) of living space boasts Four Master Suites with their own lounge area and en suite bathroom containing separate shower and bath space, with each having private terrace or direct access opening to the cliff edge pool. The fourth floor Penthouse Suite features a stunning 88 m2  (950 ft2) of open marble terrace, one of the premier spots in Bali from where you can see the cliffs running down the coast, the surf right out front of you, and the distant shores of Kuta, Seminyak and Canggu across the vast ocean bay and also to enjoy the spectacular light show every sunset brings.  Beside this in the evening there no black void looking into the dark ocean abyss when the sun goes down as the twinkling lights of the Kuta - Seminyak shoreline can be seen across the bay. The King-size Beds strategically placed to catch the views have the most comfortable absolute top end mattresses available; high thread count cotton sheets and a variety of hardness non-allergic microfiber pillows.    The third floor feature two grand bedroom suites with stunning ensuite bathrooms with separate showers and baths and outside terraces, these are the OceanView Suite and the Rainforest Suite.The second floor is the living dining upper ground level. It contains several lounge areas, family tv area, a grand dining area , a celebrity kitchen using absolute top shelf appliances with a master chef and butler included. This floor at one end leads to a beautiful rainforest grove complete with two large banyan trees, a multitude of ferns, palms, waterfalls and koi ponds, the other end of the second floor is an unrestricted view of the ocean with cliffs running down to Balangan Beach. Stand at the edge of the lawn and watch the surfers paddling by. The Cliff Edge Pool Suite is located on the lower ground floor and contains either two single beds or a king size double bed (as requested), and spacious private lounge space that opens out directly onto the large cliff edge pool, pergola and gardens. The fourth bedroom has a bathroom with a luxurious high flow shower (no bath) and when desired this suite can be locked from the rest of the villa  to be a self contained apartment with it's own private entrance. This space is perfect for  high end clients that travel with an assistant and desire them to be close by but not too close. The  lower ground level also holds the fun zone , with a gym, a dry redwood cedar sauna, a steam room, massage spa, and dedicated home theatre.  The Meals. The very talented Chef prepares meals of the highest standard of quality and flavour. Many guests come with the intention of eating out at the high end restaurants Bali is so well know for, but after experiencing the quality of the in-house chef prepared meals served by your own butler and waiter, they often forgo the visits to other restaurants. Guests are charged a 20% surcharge for groceries and produce and the chef prepares meals from that.  The cost saving for meals alone becomes quite significant. Please Read the guest reviews about the meals. The same with Drinks, the villa does not sell drinks, but rather authentic origin bottles of wines and spirits are purchased at a 20% surcharge and the butler with a significant saving for you mixes cocktails. The property was purchased well before most any other property on the southern peninsular at a time when they had the choice and means to buy anywhere and sat on for a decade while planning the grounds.  Being already well informed on building locations and sun orientation they noticed two significant features almost no other site on the coastline provided.  Firstly the property actually faces north across the ocean with Mt Agung and the other volcanoes of Bali in the distant background. What this aspect means is a significantly cooler space where you get ocean views all day long without the intense and often uncomfortable heat of the sun beaming into and heating up your villa, and secondly this site is one of less than a handful with terraced grounds all the way down to just above the waters edge.  Once again, this is not a villa built on a normal business budget as a as an upmarket hotel might; they often are the obvious ones all bundled together like cookie cutter suburbs.  This is a unique high net worth owners villa in a very private gated estate of only three properties all built and owned by three high net worth individuals. No look after 70 villa  management companies, no built by a developer or commercial operation  and the significantly lower quality build, fixtures and infrastructure one will undoubtedly get from such a set up, rather a truly unique villa of the highest order in a unique setting.  Please read our guest comments, you will see by glowing reviews how much previous guests have appreciated what they experienced and how much they enjoyed their stay.  You really owe it to yourself. The Prices are for a rental of the 2 Bedroom option for up to 4 Adults   ( or 2 adults 2 children ).

You'll spot beautiful butterflies fluttering through the air, but you'll also come across a whole host of other creatures—some familiar, some a bit more unusual—all with their own unique colors and shapes and sounds. We believe in living in harmony with the rest of nature and want to offer our guests an authentic experience of this rich, untamed ecosystem.Staying with us comes with its own soundtrack. Guests should be aware that, particularly when the weather is warm, we get bursts of very LOUD 'screeching' from our native cicadas. They are small (about the size of a thumb), but their volume is impressive. It’s a unique sound of the wilderness that guests should be prepared for.Geckos of various sizes make their homes with us, and though harmless, they do add their distinctive calls at night. In return, they’re incredibly helpful, keeping our space clear of pests - in Balinese culture they're considered bringers of good energy!Our garden is home to playful squirrels, colourful birds, and curious lizards. At sunset, you might see bats flying around, and the jungle fills with a chorus of sounds, from croaking frogs to chirping crickets. As night falls, you might be lucky enough to see fireflies glowing over the rice paddies.The jungle is a place where nature shows up in every possible form.While we deeply appreciate the beauty and balance of this wild environment, we understand that the intensity of nature here may be overwhelming for some. *** Please take a moment to consider whether this unique, immersive experience aligns with what you're seeking during your stay.  ***FULLY PLANT-BASED PROPERTYThe Jungle Nook is 100% plant-based, from the delicious meals cooked by our chef Made to the fragrant soaps and scented candles. Most of our guests are non-vegan and love the experience :)You are welcome to cook your own meals as well and we can help with shopping. We kindly ask not to bring any animal products to the cottage.PARKINGIf you come with your own car, please note we have only one (!) parking spot available at the villa. Please inform us upon booking so we can reserve it for you.",

  "title": "Hidden Architectural Masterpiece in East Bali",
  "description": "Where the river meets the sea, Villa Agung is a hidden masterpiece on Bali’s tranquil east coast. Set within Campuhan, our five-acre oceanfront estate celebrated in Architectural Digest, it embodies timeless Indonesian craftsmanship and the harmony of architecture, nature, and the Balinese spirit.The spaceVilla Agung is the grand residence of Campuhan, a 2,500-square-foot pavilion built entirely by hand from reclaimed teak and ironwood. Its soaring 30-foot alang-alang roof, woven bamboo walls, and wide sliding doors create a seamless connection between home and horizon. From every angle the villa opens to extraordinary views: Mount Agung rising in striking majesty behind, the Lombok Strait stretching out in front, a white limestone private swimming pool set among manicured gardens, and the shifting light of sea and sky visible throughout the day. The open-plan design balances a restful sleeping area perfectly framed by Mount Agung, with a spacious living pavilion facing the ocean. A king bed suite dressed in fine linens invites deep rest, while the adjacent lounge offers space for reading, reflection, or conversation. His-and-hers volcanic-stone bathrooms and a two-person soaking tub complete this elegant retreat. Crafted using traditional mortise-and-tenon joinery, without a single nail, by Minangkabau artisans, the villa embodies both ancient artistry and contemporary grace. Here, the beauty of natural materials, the rhythm of the waves, and the spirit of Bali compose a quiet symphony of serenity.Guest accessGuests of Villa Agung enjoy full access to the heartbeat of the property, the Campuhan Lounge. This 2,500-sq-ft open-air living and dining pavilion overlooks the sea, mountains, and river. Built entirely without nails or screws, it serves as the estate’s gathering place, where guests read, dine, or simply watch the light shift across the water. You’ll also have access to the main infinity pool, seaside spa pavilion, and vast manicured lawns that stretch to the ocean’s edge. A member of our team will be at the property to personally greet you upon arrival, assist with check-in, and make you feel at home from the very first moment. Our team of fifteen full-time staff provide discreet and intuitive service, ensuring every need is met with warmth and care. A custom-made breakfast for two is included each morning. Our chefs are available 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., offering à la carte lunch and dinner menus prepared from local organic produce and the day’s fresh ocean catch, a genuine farm- and boat-to-table experience. Every villa is completely private and self-contained, allowing you to enjoy both seclusion and the shared beauty of the estate’s surroundings.Other things to note- Maximum occupancy: 2 guests per villa- To maintain the privacy, calm, and security of all guests, only registered guests may enter the estate. Parties or gatherings are not permitted.- Daily breakfast from our generous menu is included for two guests.- Daily housekeeping and evening turndown service are provided.- Airport transfers, private drivers, and day excursions can be arranged on request.- Wi-Fi is available throughout the property, though many guests find the true connection here comes from the surrounding nature.The rhythm of the sea, the sound of the river, and the presence of Mount Agung create a sense of quiet restoration. To truly understand Campuhan, one must experience it — where the river meets the sea.",

  "title": "The Writers' Treehouse – a unique, creative home",
  "description": "The Writers' Treehouse is a cool, airy home 250m from the beach; it's surrounded by trees and a tropical garden, and has views across forested hills. Treehouse is an inspiring place in which to read, write, create, cook or relax (there are two swinging chairs), and from where to take long walks on an unspoiled beach. An eco-hotel is a 5-min walk away; you may use their pool if you have a meal or massage there. Medewi surf point is a 7-minute drive away.The spaceThe Writers' Treehouse was built around an old mango tree; upstairs the glass doors open onto its branches and downstairs the house is open to the tropical environment. It is a very comfortable home – but this style of accommodation is not for everybody. If you are more comfortable in city spaces and are looking for a cocooned apartment or a hip neighbourhood like Canggu, then Treehouse is not for you... but if you're an independent traveller who enjoys being in nature and seeks to connect with the soul of a place, you're likely to consider Treehouse heaven. * Please note that Treehouse is NOT a pet-friendly (dogs are welcome at Hidden Well, our charming cottage near Treehouse – please click my profile to view it). Also, we cannot accept bookings from people travelling with children under the age of 8, due to safety concerns relating to the design of the house (open staircase and full-length window-doors upstairs).BEDROOMUpstairs the large room is divided by a custom-designed cupboard (all furniture was made by local artisans). In one half is the queen-size bed, which has views across tree-tops to forest-covered hills. The other half is a studio space with packed book shelves, a hanging chair, a daybed and a desk.BATHROOMThe outdoor bathroom (surrounded by a high stone wall) is shaded by palm trees lush with bromeliads, ferns and orchids. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and hand wash are provided and yes, there is hot water :)KITCHENThe kitchen is well equipped with: Fridge with freezer; gas stove; small electric oven; wok; pots; frying pan; filter coffee machine; blender; drinking water.  Baking equipment includes: muffin and loaf tin, digital scale, measuring cups and spoons. WIFIThere is a 50MBPS fibre Internet connection. The speed does vary slightly, but it is more than sufficient to hold Zoom meetings, transfer high-res photos and watch Netflix.SURFING & YOGAThere is a quiver of surfboards that you are welcome to use – they range from 5'8\" to 9'0\". Please bring your own leash. In the cupboard upstairs you'll find a yoga mat, two blocks and two straps.Guest accessYou will have full, exclusive use of The Writers' Treehouse.Other things to noteThe Writers' Treehouse is an enchanting base for travellers who're wanting to connect with nature and authentic Balinese village life. Our intention is for guests to feel  at home and to experience the true magic of the area – so we provide a comprehensive \"address book\" and recommendations of places to go, things to do that will deepen your experience of West Bali. EXPERIENCE LOCAL LIFEOn all bookings 3 nights or longer we offer a complimentary pink-buffalo and rice paddy experience – a wonderful opportunity to learn more about traditional Balinese life.NEIGHBOURHOOD VIBESOn Wednesday nights (until around 9pm or 10pm), on a neighbouring property, the village's gamelan musicians practise angklung, a beautiful traditional music that features wind instruments; on some Thursday nights they practise joget, which is indigenous to West Bali and rarely heard or played outside of this area. You will hear this music from Treehouse, and you are so welcome watch this music being performed.Karaoke has become popular in the village, and you will also hear the prayer calls from the village mosque, as well as roosters, dogs and birds. While these sounds might disturb light sleepers, they are an integral part of an authentic Bali experience. If you're looking for a quiet, restorative retreat then you might consider staying Hidden Well, our cottage a few minutes' drive from Treehouse. Please click on my profile to view it. We do our best to ensure that every guest’s stay is flawless, but from time to time things crop up that are beyond our control (eg loud music played at neighbourhood weddings / flying ants emerging after rain / the electricity or water supply is temporarily interrupted). Your comfort is our priority and we work closely with our community to ensure that anything that needs our attention is addressed as soon as possible.NO DOGS, PLEASEThe Writers' Treehouse is NOT a pet-friendly property. If you're looking for somewhere that is, please click on my profile to connect with our other cottage, Hidden Well, where dogs are welcome.",

  "description": "Enjoy your stay in one of our cozy beach front bungalows right in front of the main surf break in Medewi. Our newly built bungalow is only a few steps away from the main surf break in Medewi and right next to the fishing village/market. The colorful fishing boats are parked right on our beach front and there is always a buzz with fishermen going out to sea for their daily catch.  We also have BBQ and breakfast sets available at an additional cost, these are not included.The spaceThis quirky bungalow looks like something out of a children’s book. Built almost entirely out of bamboo, it hosts a huge round window facing the ocean that allows you to look out onto the surf right from your bed. A comfortable net serves as a balcony, allowing for the most incredible chill-out space overlooking the surf, beach and lush gardens. Sunsets from this net are beyond words.The bathroom is small but it’s transparent ceiling makes it feel bright and spacious. It also has its own window with direct line of sight onto another of Medewi’s beach breaks. The bungalow has a private fully equipped kitchen an outdoor shower and lots of dining space.Our luscious garden is open for all our guests and it has a fire pit that doubles as a BBQ area.Guest accessOur bungalows are situated right at the beach front, allowing our guests to have easy access to to Medewi’s main surf break and to experience the local atmosphere.The locals are very friendly and welcoming. The colorful fishing boats are parked right on our beach front and there is always a buzz with fishermen going out to sea for their daily catch.Guests have full access to our gardens, including outdoor dinning table and bbq area.Outdoor showers and surfboard racks are available for all our guests.Other things to noteThe neighborhood in Medewi is mostly Muslim and that requires that our guests become aware of the calls for prayer that happens 5 times per day, including the first at around 5am (great timing for that morning surf). The tropical gardens around the property host a increasing variety of fruits and tropical plants grown organically. This means that there is also many birds, bees and other cute insects around. Most of them stay way out of our bungalows but occasionally our guest might find a small bug or two venturing inside the room.Please note that we are often doing some construction work happening during the daytime on the property. The construction work is only happening in between 9am and 5pm and it’s done mostly with hand tools to keep the noise levels as low as possible, but at times will be a little noisy. The four craftsmen working for us have been doing so since we started our project. They are currently building our fifth bungalow. These local men are our neighbors and we consider them a part of our Medewi “family”. They are all very nice, friendly and respectful. Watching them hand craft our bamboo bungalows can be quite a positive experience and we hope it won’t stop you from booking your stay at Batu Kayu.",

  "title": "Dream Home in Ubud: House of Lights",
  "description": "3BR luxury pool villa, a true sanctuary for the seasoned traveller, praised in interior design magazines worldwide, in arguably the most desired street of Ubud. Exceptional daily housekeeping is included! It's a welcoming home built by Bali's star architect. Magnificent views on the famous Sayan Ridge & the sunset - watch it from the pool or the terrace while you're listening to the river and the birds in complete privacy and luxurious comfort, in harmony with nature. Bali at its best.The spaceThis house is a rare gem in Bali - off the beaten villa track... A place where one can really feel at home, as this luxurious villa is a real home of a real family, not the usual holiday rental. In 2021 and 2022 the stunning property was fully renovated in this postcard perfect art village of Ubud, using the finest materials, inspired by our family's extended travels across the world, to create our ultimate tropical dream villa, in perfect harmony with nature. In 2023 and 2024 the property was featured in renowned interior magazines from Europe to Asia like ELLE Decoration, The Residence and Tatler Homes.The 80sqm living room, the dining area along with the bar, plus the kitchen are really the heart of the villa where you will spend a lot of quality time with your loved ones, overlooking the garden, the infinity pool and the unforgettable view. Or you can retreat to one of the two oversized Master Bedrooms for total privacy and undisturbed sunset views from their terraces - and their bath tubs :-)Our son's bedroom and one of the Master Bedrooms are connected by a lovely glass room (which can also serve as an office space) to make it convenient for families with small kids who don't want their children to walk through the garden in the night. This family friendly layout is quite rare in Bali.  The children room is a highlight in itself, it has a beautiful antique Balinese daybed (Double Bed size: 220cm x 135 cm), and the room also comes with its own ensuite bathroom with two sinks plus a pleasant tropical rainshower.The two Master Bedrooms are totally independent in two different units on the two sides of the pool, with their own huge private terraces facing the dramatic Sayan Ridge, with their own bath tubs (also with fantastic views), tropical rainshowers and walk-in closets / dressing rooms (also airconditioned). The 100% natural amenities of Balinese luxury brand Sensatia are provided in all three bathrooms (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, handwash and bath salt). High-quality Egyptian cotton bed linens and luxury curtains will take care of your sweet dreams. Our guests are having some of the best sleeps of their lives here at House of Lights, Ubud.If you want you can make the living room totally enclosed by the beautiful french windows and doors, not losing the wonderful view but creating an even more intimate and homey ambiance for the evening. (It is also airconditioned.)On our large Samsung smart TV (\"The Frame\") you can log in to your favourite streaming platform (Disney+, Netflix, etc. - our internet speed is up to 175 Mbps). Or you can just leave the TV on as a painting hanging on the wall, by choosing from dozens of digital masterpieces which will appear in \"The Frame\" - it is so much fun while your younger children might get an introduction to art history while staying here :-)The kitchen is fully functional with a huge fridge, freezer, stove, oven, water dispenser, Nespresso coffee machine, milk frother, electric hand mixer, rice cooker, toaster and a Philips Pro Blender for your daily fresh vitamine intake. The kitchen can be completely closed off and air-conditioned if that is your preference, though we enjoy it open even more, serving drinks across the brass bar counter while cooking a nice meal - often with the help of our dear staff at the villa. As a guest you could also count on them as our home comes with daily housekeeping included in the rate. If you are happy with your hosts' outstanding service, a nice tip is highly appreciated and goes a long way here in Bali. Thank you!Guest accessThe villa has its own private infinity pool overlooking the magnificent Sayan Ridge. The entire property is all yours.Other things to noteOur home is most convenient for 2 couples and their kids in the Kids Room (Bedroom 3) or 5 adults plus small kids on extra beds.Our fully staffed villa is taken care of by our lovely house keeper, a gardener, a pool attendant and our driver. We kindly ask you to leave a nice tip for them if you are happy with their service. Our driver can drive you around Ubud and take you for excursions in a Toyota 7-seater for an additional daily rate.You can also rent our mountainbike for 20 usd per day to discover beautiful little villages and magnificent rice fields you would never reach by car and which are too far on foot. We love it...Breakfast and some local dishes on site can be arranged for an additional fee, like one of our lovely staff's famous traditional Soto Ayam (it is an amazing rich chicken soup). Massage, pedicure and manicure can also be arranged by our highly professional therapist whose service is absolutely outstanding, based on her availability.Smoking is strictly prohibited inside, it is only permitted outside: in the garden and on the terraces.Oliver, our 18-month-old toy poodle is an optional sweet little package here. Most of our guests are in love with this well-trained and adorable dog. Our dear staff take care of him 100% - you can just enjoy his personality if you wish. Please feel free to let us know if you don't  so we can arrange him staying elsewhere, no problem at all, he has fans all around the island :-)",

  "title": "Veluvana Bali - Scorpio House",
  "description": "Veluvana is a unique bamboo house with magical Mount Agung and the lush Sidemen Valley. Each house is inspired by various animals’ structure as part of the creatures in the world and takes advantage of the open space concept which provides a deep connection with nature that aim to give positive energy to recover your soul. From the concept to material selection, we are trying to contribute to the sustainability principleThe spaceScorpio House welcomes you with mysterious beauty through a giant and iconic design where you will be surprised by the hidden ground pool beneath the main bedroom as you walk down the staircase. Take a moment to walk or hang along the iconic and sharp pool edge, then indulge in a floating breakfast in the morning while taking in the view in restful contemplation with the sounds of nature.The main room is accessed by climbing up the automatic stairs from the first floor. When you open the deck, it directly heads to your private main room. You will be greeted by a moving-laid-back bed equipped with a mosquito net that allows you to merge into the surrounding landscapes with a click!We invite you to feel this blissful vibe of the house. Let nature entertains you with no boundaries at Veluvana Bali. Other things to noteBEFORE YOU BOOK, PLEASE READ A FEW DETAILS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:1. The Construction & Your Own SafetyThe construction and furniture are mostly made of locally-sourced bamboo that covered with reclaimed teak wood roofs. The building is designed and built by local bamboo artisans with serious consideration to the strength of the entire part of the construction and furniture. Don't put everyone in a danger by bringing any flammable material or liquid that is ignited or flame immediately when in contact with fire. The lower-level floor is a half meter from the ground with a higher edge on the north porch; please take care of your step while playing on this site. The upper level is 2.5 meters from the ground with hidden stairs that automatically opened once you click the remote button. All the stairs are considered easy to climb but keep in mind to watch your head and step as the Scorpio House does not have any railing to hold. Accidents due to negligence entirely become your personal responsibility.2. Water, Electricity, and Wi-FiThe water you use in this house is supplied by the regional water company that distributes fresh water sourced from Mount Agung aquifer. Although the water is fresh, it is not ready to drink water, so please drink only water that is served in the bottle and ask the doormen to refill if it runs out. The electricity installed in the house is connected with the main east Bali grid system to assure you have reliable lighting in the night and optimum power supply to your device. Because we understand you may physically off-grid, but your digital presence can have no break. So, Wi-Fi is free as always.3. The LocationThe small town of Sidemen is less crowded compare to Ubud and any other tourist destination in Bali. This area is slowly growing as the indigenous culture and society remain preserved by its humility. You can explore the village in a short-range by foot, a scooter is also available to rent if you want to go a little bit further to the town center or the neighbor village.4. Public FacilityThe small town of Sidemen has a village hall, traditional market, small grocery, school, and hospital with an emergency care unit. Ride a scooter around 5 – 10 minutes from the bamboo house to reach one of these facilities. Bigger public facilities are available in the nearest town of Semarapura that requires a 20-minute drive or Denpasar that is around 60 minutes from Sidemen.5. The ClimateThe climate is divided into two seasons, dry or wet. The dry season comes around May – September while the wet season is from October – April each year. However, climate change has made the weather a bit unpredictable. Sometimes there is a rainy day within the dry season, and not all day is rainy during the wet season. When you stay during the wet season please consider facing heavy rain with a wind that may blow water into the lower ground porch, and the upper balcony. 6. The BugsThe bamboo house is located within a rice terrace with rich biodiversity. Our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint has led us to design the house with minimum impact on the surrounding living organism. Stay in this bamboo house means that you are willing to share your living space with other creatures. Ants, fly, mosquito, and other insects are commonly found outside of the building especially during fruit season. As long as you keep the space clean and not leave any left food open, they will not come to disturb you. If you notice mosquito entering the bedroom area, we highly recommend you to use the mosquito net on the bed during your sleep. If you have a specific insect allergy or afraid of these insects, we suggest this bamboo house is not good for you. Or you may go at your own risk.7. Room ServicesYou have a doormen stand-by at 7.00 am – 9.00 pm at the upper ground, you can ask him almost anything you need to make your stay enjoyable. He will help you with breakfast, food for lunch and dinner, find a masseur, room cleaning, laundry, transportation, area information, and tourist activities. You can also contact us online through Airbnb platform in case the onsite services do not meet your needs.8. Breakfast, Lunch, and DinnerBreakfast for two is included in your booking. You can ask the doormen to serve the breakfast in the living room area, on the couch or you feel too heavy to wake up from your bed, the breakfast will be served at your convenience. For an extra special morning treat, book our floating breakfast with additional charge. We have a small kitchen in the upper ground so that you can order food for your lunch as well as dinner. 9. Air ConditioningWe do not install air conditioning in the house as it is against our spirit to maintain natural air remain fresh and healthy. Matter-fact we think we do not need that urban stuff around Sidemen Village, especially when you let the soft natural wind flows into your space.10. Protection from a Set of Curtains and Roll-up BlindsWe are adding a set of curtains placed in the entrance corner and roll-up blinds at the lower ground. Those all protect you from heavy water droplets and outside elements that may discomfort you, especially during the rainy season, night or unexpectedly harsh wind, as we are fully adopting an open-space design. Rest assured it zipped again to keep the curtains from blowing all over the place when it's not used anymore.11. The Neighbourhood and Surrounding ActivitiesAs the bamboo house is located in the main tourist district of Sidemen, several accommodations, restaurants and human activities are situated and happened near your space. You will see some buildings on the west or east side of the house. Right at the back of the house is also accommodation with several rooms. The neighbour is warm and friendly, especially the owner of the surrounding properties. Sometimes during daylight, you may find the farmers working in their rice fields. You can enjoy it as a truly rural view, as the farmer is also a part of our team. But if you need additional privacy, don't worry! We can ask them to not go to the rice fields for your whole privacy.12. Open-air Showering Concept All experiences have to be set as sustainable as possible, including showering! We bring you closer to nature with an open-design bathroom and shower. Let's take a shower under the sky in the morning and evening while enjoying the breeze flowing. It gets dramatic when the rain suddenly comes, all you have to do is just dance a bit with the raindrop to cleanse your body one more time. The bathroom/shower has set in a very private way, so that, if there is someone watching it would be a curious bird!13. Moving BedSurprisingly, you can take your comfort and stay experience to the next level with a moving bed that can be controlled with a remote control in which every click brings you closer to magical views. On the other note, please watch your position and the distance between the bed and the edge of the floor.14. Irresponsible BehaviorIrresponsible behavior and threatening and abusive conduct towards the host, doormen, neighbors of the house, and the villager will not be tolerated. The host will refuse to allow check-in to the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. The host also has a full authority to end guest stay in the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. No refund will be given regarding the cancelation/canceled stay due to irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above.The host will not have a further responsibility to the guest once the booking is canceled and or the stay is ended.",

  "title": "The Longhouse Jimbaran - Bali",
  "description": "The spaceOne-eighty-degree views stretch beyond a 60-square-meter pool at this traditional villa perched atop Jimbaran Hill. The verdant Bali countryside unfurls in front of an open-sided living area designed by prominent Indonesian architect Popo Danes and overseen by a full staff. Do laps in your own pool or make the 10-minute drive to swim, surf, and dine on seafood at Jimbaran Beach. During your holiday at The Longhouse, a chef, butler, and housekeeper will pamper you, and you’ll have private access to boutique-hotel-worthy amenities from an infinity pool and yoga area to a barbecue and al-fresco wet bar. This luxury property also features a home gym and spa area, plus a smart TV, surround-sound system, and Wi-Fi. The living areas at this vacation rental are set in an open-sided pavilion with a traditional alang-alang roof. Reconnect with friends and family around a dining table for 14, or catch up on reading in one of the quiet lounge areas. Though chef service is included in your stay, the villa does have a fully equipped kitchen. The Longhouse has 3 bedrooms with king beds, including one that feels like a honeymoon suite with its al-fresco shower and plunge pool. There are also 2 bedrooms with 2 twin beds each, and one bedroom with a queen bed. All 6 bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms. The villa’s location in the Kuta Selatan area gives you a taste of the real Bali. The closest town is Jimbaran, a 10-minute drive away, where you can spend a day on the white-sand beach, browse for the perfect souvenir in the shops, or join the locals in one of the many celebrations that still take place at the temple in front of the town’s market. For more restaurant options or a night out on the town, it’s a 30-minute drive to Seminyak. Copyright © Luxury Retreats.

  "title": "Amazing 7 Bedroom Heart Of Seminyak-Oberoi",
  "description": "The Villa sits on 1800sqm of landscaped gardens just 300m from Seminyak’s best beach, featuring 7 bedroom Villa. The Villa, right in the heart of prestigious Oberoi district, is only 300 meters from Ku De Ta and can comfortably accommodate up to 16 guests.The spaceThe villa consist of a 6 bedroom and 4 bedroom connected villa, both feature L shaped, signature swimming pools, huge living rooms, indoor and outdoor lounging and dining, pool tables, vast individual bedroom suites, world-class interior design with a distinct Balinese theme, and every conceivable luxury for the sophisticated holidaymaker. We will lock three of the bedroom during your stay, and two only if you book for 16 guest.The villa has unrivalled facilities with 15 full-time staff, including a private butler for each villa, chefs, housekeeping, gardener and trained security, plus on-demand chauffeurs, spa therapists and concierge, all of whom are dedicated to ensuring guests are pampered during every moment of their stay, except of course when they hang out the red ‘do not disturb’ flag to ensure total privacy.Guest accessIndoor livingThe vast open-sided and open-plan living areas that spread across the garden levels of the two pavilions form the social hubs of the villa. These are spectacular spaces for relaxing and entertaining, defined by soaring teakwood columns and skillfully divided into separate activity areas, with the swimming pools edging almost into the rooms. On one side, conversation is sure to flow with the configuration of oversized sofas arranged around huge coffee tables, set before bars with stools, drinks fridges and glass jars full of snacks. With an equally social focus, full-size billiard tables are centrally located. Opposite, comfortable sofas and armchairs are grouped around 52, 46 and 40 inch flat-screen satellite TVs and home entertainment systems.The dining areas are equally generous. The 6 bedroom side of the estate offers an enormous slab of teakwood fashioned into a statement dining table seating 20 people, with room to spare. A smaller, but equally attractive table is provided on the 4 bedroom side. Behind an island buffet of black granite, are guest kitchens, which are well equipped with American-style fridges, hobs, ovens, microwaves and an extensive collection of plates and utensils housed in handsome wooden cupboards. Doors from these areas lead to the 'back of house' section, with separate staff kitchen allowing for extra guest privacy whilst the resident chefs are preparing meals.Outdoor livingThe villa offers a wide range of outdoor living areas in keeping with the same highly social space planning that define its interiors. The 12m and 14m swimming pools, with water-feature on the boundary walls and wide shallow steps leading towards the living areas, are the perfect spots to cool off, while ironwood decks with stylish sun loungers shaded by beautiful parasols provide ideal settings for alfresco siestas or refreshing sundowners.The many terraces and decks at both levels of all three pavilions provide opportunities for private relaxation while enjoying views of the beautifully landscaped gardens, with an old Cambodia frangipani, a sacred Pohon Pile tree and Sawit date palms that have been specially imported from Java.Other things to noteGuests who wish to enjoy home cooking in the privacy of the Villa will appreciate the resident full time chef who will happily prepare a wide range of Balinese, Asian and international dishes.Food and beverage chargesAll provisions can be purchased by our housekeepers and charged to guests at cost price. Shopping receipts will be provided either daily or at the end of the stay – at your option.  It is requested that our staff be given a ‘float’ to cover the grocery shopping.Wine, beer, spirits and soft drinks are also available upon request and an account will be presented for settlement at the end of your stay.StaffGuests of the villa are looked after, with great attention to detail, by a dedicated team of professionals drawn from the local community, under the direction of our villa manager. Our staff are trained to anticipate their guests’ every whim with typical Balinese charm and a ready smile. They are very much part of the villa experience.Villa manager\tOur villa manager is responsible for the overall operation of the villa, including staffing and guest satisfaction. Fluent in English, she warmly familiarizes guests with the villa on arrival and is only a phone call away should you have any special requests.Chef\tThe resident full time chef is skilled at cooking a wide array of international and Indonesian cuisine.Housekeepers\tA team of seven housekeepers takes care of cleaning and tidying the villa in shifts from 7am to 11pm. They also prepare breakfast and can shop for groceries if required.Gardener/pool attendant\tA gardener discreetly tends to the pools and gardens every day.Spa therapists\tFully trained spa therapists will visit the villa upon request to provide massages and other spa treatments on guest account.Security\tNight-time security is provided by trained staff.SpaFeel like a body scrub or massage? Just ask our staff to bring the spa to you! We can recommend deluxe treatments carried out in the privacy of the villa – be it by the pool, on the terrace or in the cool of the bedroom – by fully trained therapists from a reputable local spa (extra charges will apply). Here’s a sample of what’s on the menu:Balinese massageRelease built up tension with a traditional Balinese massage. Using a combination of gentle stretches, acupressure and aromatherapy oils to stimulate the flow of blood, oxygen and energy around your body, you will feel totally relaxed in no time.Foot reflexologyFoot reflexology is a natural healing art based on the principle that there are reflexes in the feet which correspond to every part of the body. Through application of pressure on these reflexes tension is relieved and circulation improved leaving you feeling balanced.Body scrubA full body scrub will exfoliate and hydrate your skin leaving it soft and smooth. A rejuvenating scrub combines an abrasive material such as salt, coffee, rice bran or pecan hulls with essential oils to remove any impurities and make your skin glow.Manicure/pedicureOur hands and feet work hard for us every day but rarely get the attention they deserve. Treat them to a manicure or pedicure, which usually comes with the added bonus of a quick hand or foot massage.FamiliesThe family-friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many and varied, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is real plus – and ensures that parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday.The villa is ideal for families. Younger children can be easily supervised in the pools, as they are visible from all areas of the open-plan living room, and will enjoy watching TV in the living areas or the second floor media room. Older kids will gravitate to the billiard tables, appreciate the size and privacy of the bedrooms, and revel in the chance to wander out safely to the beach, shops and nightlife of Seminyak.Our friendly staff will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost). Although well equipped kitchens allow you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest.Nor do you have to worry about packing all that cumbersome extra equipment. When you stay at the villa, we can provide you with all the essentials. We have a cot and high chair, and anything we don’t have in-house, we can generally hire for a small fee. Just talk through your requirements with us when you make your reservation and we’ll make sure it’s all ready and waiting for your arrival.We are required by local regulations to charge occupancy tax. Villa rate is subject to 15,5% government taxes and services charge, not included in the price of the reservation and have to be paid directly upon check-in.

Our AC are cleaned regularly. However, letting warm air getting inside your bedroom makes their functioning less effective.* Bali being a tropical island, it is not unusual to spot exotic animals from time to time (bats, lizards, bugs…). All of them are completely harmless and part of local everyday life.* The main villa living/common area is semi-open with no AC. However ceiling fans are available and the sliding glass door can be opened, allowing the natural breeze to flow/circulate throughout the space.* Please note that on the island, whilst usually short, occasional blackouts do happen. If this unlikely event happens, the Villa is equipped with lithium-battery backup providing continuity of services for all essential services (note that AC will not operate during blackout nor tap water. However, potable water is available from the water dispenser).===FAQs- Q: What is the Check-in time policy?-A: Check-in time is at 14:00 at the earliest. Arriving earlier?

  "title": "Veluvana Bali - Cobra House",
  "description": "Cobra House one of our most cherished habitable sculptures and an ode to tasteful design in harmony with the environment.Other things to noteBEFORE YOU BOOK, PLEASE READ A FEW DETAILS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:1. The ConstructionThe construction and furniture are mostly made of locally-sourced bamboo that covered with rice straw roofs. The building is designed and built by local bamboo artisans with serious consideration to the strength of the entire part of the construction and furniture. The lower level floor is a half meter from the ground with a higher edge on the north porch; please take care of your step while playing on this site. The upper level is 2.5 meters from the ground with stairs that are considered easy to climb; watch your head and hold the railing for your safety.2. Water, Electricity, and Wi-FiThe water you use in this house is supplied by the regional water company that distributes fresh water sourced from Mount Agung aquifer. Although the water is fresh, it is not ready to drink water, so please drink only water that is served in the bottle and ask the doormen to refill if it runs out. The electricity installed in the house is connected with the main east Bali grid system to assure you have reliable lighting in the night and optimum power supply to your device. Because we understand you may physically off-grid, but your digital presence can have no break. So, Wi-Fi is free as always.3. The LocationThe small town of Sidemen is less crowded compare to Ubud and any other tourist destination in Bali. This area is slowly growing as the indigenous culture and society remain preserved by its humility. You can explore the village in a short-range by foot, a scooter is also available to rent if you want to go a little bit further to the town center or the neighbor village.4. Public FacilityThe small town of Sidemen has a village hall, traditional market, small grocery, school, and hospital with an emergency care unit. Ride a scooter around 5 – 10 minutes from the bamboo house to reach one of these facilities. Bigger public facilities are available in the nearest town of Semarapura that requires a 20-minute drive or Denpasar that is around 60 minutes from Sidemen.5. The ClimateThe climate is divided into two seasons, dry or wet. The dry season comes around May – September while the wet season is from October – April each year. However, climate change has made the weather a bit unpredictable. Sometimes there is a rainy day within the dry season, and not all day is rainy during the wet season. When you stay during the wet season please consider facing heavy rain with a wind that may blow water into the lower ground porch, the upper balcony, and the hanging net. However, we have installed curtains and roll-up blinds at the lower ground so you can protect yourself from rainwater or bugs in the night.6. The BugsThe bamboo house is located within a rice terrace with rich biodiversity. Our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint has led us to design the house with minimum impact on the surrounding living organism. Stay in this bamboo house means that you are willing to share your living space with other creatures. Ants, fly, mosquito, and other insects are commonly found outside of the building especially during fruit season. As long as you keep the space clean and not leave any left food open, they will not come to disturb you. If you notice mosquito entering the bedroom area, we highly recommend you to use the mosquito net on the bed during your sleep. If you have a specific insect allergy or afraid of these insects, we suggest this bamboo house is not good for you. Or you may go at your own risk.7. Room ServicesYou have a doormen stand-by at 7.00 am – 9.00 pm at the upper ground, you can ask him almost anything you need to make your stay enjoyable. He will help you with breakfast, food for lunch and dinner, find a masseur, room cleaning, laundry, transportation, area information, and tourist activities. You can also contact us online through Airbnb platform in case the onsite services do not meet your needs.8. Breakfast, Lunch, and DinnerBreakfast for two is included in your booking. You can ask the doormen to serve the breakfast in the living room area, on the couch or you feel too heavy to wake up from your bed, the breakfast will be served at your convenience. For an extra special morning treat, book our floating breakfast with additional charge. We plan to have a small restaurant in the upper ground so that you can order food for your lunch as well as dinner with additional charge.9. Air ConditioningWe do not install air conditioning in the house as it is against our spirit to maintain natural air remain fresh and healthy. Matter-fact we think we do not need that urban stuff around Sidemen Village, especially when you let the soft natural wind flows into your space.10. Use of Hanging NetThe hanging net is made of strong string with iron steel pillars to sustain the weight of the user. Using the hanging net means you understand the risk that you may fell off to the side of the net if you are not careful. Only use the hanging net if you are confident that you have a good balance and always have your partner watching you in case you need help to get back to the room. Do not use the hanging net after hitting even a shoot of alcohol. Do not jump down from the hanging net and do not hang on it as it is your pull up bar.11. The NeighborhoodAs the bamboo house is located in the main tourist district of Sidemen, several accommodations and restaurants are situated near your space. You will see some buildings on the west side of the house. Right at the back of the house is also accommodation with several rooms. The neighbor is warm and friendly, especially the owner of the surrounding properties. However, to make sure you have great privacy during your stay, we have created a high bamboo fence at the back of the house and plant dense vegetation on each border with the neighbor property.12. Irresponsible BehaviorIrresponsible behavior and threatening and abusive conduct towards the host, doormen, neighbors of the house, and the villager will not be tolerated. The host will refuse to allow check-in to the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. The host also has a full authority to end guest stay in the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. No refund will be given regarding the cancelation/canceled stay due to irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above.The host will not have a further responsibility to the guest once the booking is canceled and or the stay is ended.",

  "description": "The Villa sits on 1800sqm of landscaped gardens just 300m from Seminyak’s best beach, featuring 8 bedroom Villa. The Villa, right in the heart of prestigious Oberoi district, is only 300 meters from Ku De Ta and can comfortably accommodate up to 16 guests.The spaceThe villa consist of a 6 bedroom and 4 bedroom connected villa, both feature L shaped, signature swimming pools, huge living rooms, indoor and outdoor lounging and dining, pool tables, vast individual bedroom suites, world-class interior design with a distinct Balinese theme, and every conceivable luxury for the sophisticated holidaymaker. We will lock two of the bedroom during your stay.The villa has unrivalled facilities with 15 full-time staff, including a private butler for each villa, chefs, housekeeping, gardener and trained security, plus on-demand chauffeurs, spa therapists and concierge, all of whom are dedicated to ensuring guests are pampered during every moment of their stay, except of course when they hang out the red ‘do not disturb’ flag to ensure total privacy.Guest accessIndoor livingThe vast open-sided and open-plan living areas that spread across the garden levels of the two pavilions form the social hubs of the villa. These are spectacular spaces for relaxing and entertaining, defined by soaring teakwood columns and skillfully divided into separate activity areas, with the swimming pools edging almost into the rooms. On one side, conversation is sure to flow with the configuration of oversized sofas arranged around huge coffee tables, set before bars with stools, drinks fridges and glass jars full of snacks. With an equally social focus, full-size billiard tables are centrally located. Opposite, comfortable sofas and armchairs are grouped around 52, 46 and 40 inch flat-screen satellite TVs and home entertainment systems.The dining areas are equally generous. The 6 bedroom side of the estate offers an enormous slab of teakwood fashioned into a statement dining table seating 20 people, with room to spare. A smaller, but equally attractive table is provided on the 4 bedroom side. Behind an island buffet of black granite, are guest kitchens, which are well equipped with American-style fridges, hobs, ovens, microwaves and an extensive collection of plates and utensils housed in handsome wooden cupboards. Doors from these areas lead to the 'back of house' section, with separate staff kitchen allowing for extra guest privacy whilst the resident chefs are preparing meals.Outdoor livingThe villa offers a wide range of outdoor living areas in keeping with the same highly social space planning that define its interiors. The 12m and 14m swimming pools, with water-feature on the boundary walls and wide shallow steps leading towards the living areas, are the perfect spots to cool off, while ironwood decks with stylish sun loungers shaded by beautiful parasols provide ideal settings for alfresco siestas or refreshing sundowners.The many terraces and decks at both levels of all three pavilions provide opportunities for private relaxation while enjoying views of the beautifully landscaped gardens, with an old Cambodia frangipani, a sacred Pohon Pile tree and Sawit date palms that have been specially imported from Java.Other things to noteGuests who wish to enjoy home cooking in the privacy of the Villa will appreciate the resident full time chef who will happily prepare a wide range of Balinese, Asian and international dishes.Food and beverage chargesAll provisions can be purchased by our housekeepers and charged to guests at cost price. Shopping receipts will be provided either daily or at the end of the stay – at your option.  It is requested that our staff be given a ‘float’ to cover the grocery shopping.Wine, beer, spirits and soft drinks are also available upon request and an account will be presented for settlement at the end of your stay.StaffGuests of the villa are looked after, with great attention to detail, by a dedicated team of professionals drawn from the local community, under the direction of our villa manager. Our staff are trained to anticipate their guests’ every whim with typical Balinese charm and a ready smile. They are very much part of the villa experience.Villa manager\tOur villa manager is responsible for the overall operation of the villa, including staffing and guest satisfaction. Fluent in English, she warmly familiarizes guests with the villa on arrival and is only a phone call away should you have any special requests.Chef\tThe resident full time chef is skilled at cooking a wide array of international and Indonesian cuisine.Housekeepers\tA team of seven housekeepers takes care of cleaning and tidying the villa in shifts from 7am to 11pm. They also prepare breakfast and can shop for groceries if required.Gardener/pool attendant\tA gardener discreetly tends to the pools and gardens every day.Spa therapists\tFully trained spa therapists will visit the villa upon request to provide massages and other spa treatments on guest account.Security\tNight-time security is provided by trained staff.SpaFeel like a body scrub or massage? Just ask our staff to bring the spa to you! We can recommend deluxe treatments carried out in the privacy of the villa – be it by the pool, on the terrace or in the cool of the bedroom – by fully trained therapists from a reputable local spa (extra charges will apply). Here’s a sample of what’s on the menu:Balinese massageRelease built up tension with a traditional Balinese massage. Using a combination of gentle stretches, acupressure and aromatherapy oils to stimulate the flow of blood, oxygen and energy around your body, you will feel totally relaxed in no time.Foot reflexologyFoot reflexology is a natural healing art based on the principle that there are reflexes in the feet which correspond to every part of the body. Through application of pressure on these reflexes tension is relieved and circulation improved leaving you feeling balanced.Body scrubA full body scrub will exfoliate and hydrate your skin leaving it soft and smooth. A rejuvenating scrub combines an abrasive material such as salt, coffee, rice bran or pecan hulls with essential oils to remove any impurities and make your skin glow.Manicure/pedicureOur hands and feet work hard for us every day but rarely get the attention they deserve. Treat them to a manicure or pedicure, which usually comes with the added bonus of a quick hand or foot massage.FamiliesThe family-friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many and varied, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is real plus – and ensures that parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday.The villa is ideal for families. Younger children can be easily supervised in the pools, as they are visible from all areas of the open-plan living room, and will enjoy watching TV in the living areas or the second floor media room. Older kids will gravitate to the billiard tables, appreciate the size and privacy of the bedrooms, and revel in the chance to wander out safely to the beach, shops and nightlife of Seminyak.Our friendly staff will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost). Although well equipped kitchens allow you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest.Nor do you have to worry about packing all that cumbersome extra equipment. When you stay at the villa, we can provide you with all the essentials. We have a cot and high chair, and anything we don’t have in-house, we can generally hire for a small fee. Just talk through your requirements with us when you make your reservation and we’ll make sure it’s all ready and waiting for your arrival.We are required by local regulations to charge occupancy tax. Villa rate is subject to 15,5% government taxes and services charge, not included in the price of the reservation and have to be paid directly upon check-in.

  "title": "Amazing 10 Bedroom Heart of Seminyak-Oberoi",
  "description": "The Villa sits on 1800sqm of landscaped gardens just 300m from Seminyak’s best beach, featuring  10 bedroom Villa. The Villa, right in the heart of prestigious Oberoi district, is only 300 meters from Ku De Ta and can comfortably accommodate up to 20 guests.The spaceThe villa consist of a 6 bedroom and 4 bedroom connected villa, both feature L shaped, signature swimming pools, huge living rooms, indoor and outdoor lounging and dining, pool tables, vast individual bedroom suites, world-class interior design with a distinct Balinese theme, and every conceivable luxury for the sophisticated holidaymaker.The villa has unrivalled facilities with 15 full-time staff, including a private butler for each villa, chefs, housekeeping, gardener and trained security, plus on-demand chauffeurs, spa therapists and concierge, all of whom are dedicated to ensuring guests are pampered during every moment of their stay, except of course when they hang out the red ‘do not disturb’ flag to ensure total privacy.Guest accessIndoor livingThe vast open-sided and open-plan living areas that spread across the garden levels of the two pavilions form the social hubs of the villa. These are spectacular spaces for relaxing and entertaining, defined by soaring teakwood columns and skillfully divided into separate activity areas, with the swimming pools edging almost into the rooms. On one side, conversation is sure to flow with the configuration of oversized sofas arranged around huge coffee tables, set before bars with stools, drinks fridges and glass jars full of snacks. With an equally social focus, full-size billiard tables are centrally located. Opposite, comfortable sofas and armchairs are grouped around 52, 46 and 40 inch flat-screen satellite TVs and home entertainment systems.The dining areas are equally generous. The 6 bedroom side of the estate offers an enormous slab of teakwood fashioned into a statement dining table seating 20 people, with room to spare. A smaller, but equally attractive table is provided on the 4 bedroom side. Behind an island buffet of black granite, are guest kitchens, which are well equipped with American-style fridges, hobs, ovens, microwaves and an extensive collection of plates and utensils housed in handsome wooden cupboards. Doors from these areas lead to the 'back of house' section, with separate staff kitchen allowing for extra guest privacy whilst the resident chefs are preparing meals.Outdoor livingThe villa offers a wide range of outdoor living areas in keeping with the same highly social space planning that define its interiors. The 12m and 14m swimming pools, with water-feature on the boundary walls and wide shallow steps leading towards the living areas, are the perfect spots to cool off, while ironwood decks with stylish sun loungers shaded by beautiful parasols provide ideal settings for alfresco siestas or refreshing sundowners.The many terraces and decks at both levels of all three pavilions provide opportunities for private relaxation while enjoying views of the beautifully landscaped gardens, with an old Cambodia frangipani, a sacred Pohon Pile tree and Sawit date palms that have been specially imported from Java.Other things to noteGuests who wish to enjoy home cooking in the privacy of the Villa will appreciate the resident full time chef who will happily prepare a wide range of Balinese, Asian and international dishes.Food and beverage chargesAll provisions can be purchased by our housekeepers and charged to guests at cost price. Shopping receipts will be provided either daily or at the end of the stay – at your option.

Just ask our staff to bring the spa to you! We can recommend deluxe treatments carried out in the privacy of the villa – be it by the pool, on the terrace or in the cool of the bedroom – by fully trained therapists from a reputable local spa (extra charges will apply). Here’s a sample of what’s on the menu:Balinese massageRelease built up tension with a traditional Balinese massage. Using a combination of gentle stretches, acupressure and aromatherapy oils to stimulate the flow of blood, oxygen and energy around your body, you will feel totally relaxed in no time.Foot reflexologyFoot reflexology is a natural healing art based on the principle that there are reflexes in the feet which correspond to every part of the body. Through application of pressure on these reflexes tension is relieved and circulation improved leaving you feeling balanced.Body scrubA full body scrub will exfoliate and hydrate your skin leaving it soft and smooth. A rejuvenating scrub combines an abrasive material such as salt, coffee, rice bran or pecan hulls with essential oils to remove any impurities and make your skin glow.Manicure/pedicureOur hands and feet work hard for us every day but rarely get the attention they deserve. Treat them to a manicure or pedicure, which usually comes with the added bonus of a quick hand or foot massage.FamiliesThe family-friendly advantages of a villa holiday are many and varied, including access to your own private facilities and the freedom to use them whenever you want. Knowing that the kids can run around happily, independently and safely, without you having to worry about other guests, is real plus – and ensures that parents are certain to have a more relaxed holiday.The villa is ideal for families. Younger children can be easily supervised in the pools, as they are visible from all areas of the open-plan living room, and will enjoy watching TV in the living areas or the second floor media room. Older kids will gravitate to the billiard tables, appreciate the size and privacy of the bedrooms, and revel in the chance to wander out safely to the beach, shops and nightlife of Seminyak.Our friendly staff will make children feel as welcome as adults, and having these willing helpers on hand gives guests plenty of flexibility and freedom to do their own exploring beyond the villa grounds (full-time babysitting incurs a small extra cost). Although well equipped kitchens allow you to prepare meals for fussy eaters or babies with ease, staff will happily do this for you – just talk through your requirements and meal schedules with the villa manager or chef and they will take care of the rest.Nor do you have to worry about packing all that cumbersome extra equipment. When you stay at the villa, we can provide you with all the essentials. We have a cot and high chair, and anything we don’t have in-house, we can generally hire for a small fee. Just talk through your requirements with us when you make your reservation and we’ll make sure it’s all ready and waiting for your arrival.We are required by local regulations to charge occupancy tax. Villa rate is subject to 15,5% government taxes and services charge, not included in the price of the reservation and have to be paid directly upon check-in.

Our chef prepares everything fresh on-site, and breakfast is included.Throughout the garden, you’ll find magical corners like a hammock with valley views or a small chill-out hut where you can read, sip coffee, or simply admire the horizon. Nearby, a waterfall adds a soothing melody to the ambiance.For quieter moments, a work desk with views of the infinity pool and jungle invites you to dream, write, or create. A small kitchenette lets you prepare tea or coffee to enjoy at sunrise.Finally, the round queen-size bed, surrounded by a mosquito net and hanging flowers, is where dreams are born, ensuring every night is a new adventure.Aurea is not just a place to stay—it’s a sanctuary for the soul, where every corner tells a story.* A Special Message for Our Guests *At Oniria, you'll experience an immersive journey in the heart of nature, surrounded by an open design that connects you with it.

  "title": "Laputa Villa#3  \"The Bamboo Castle in the Sky\"",
  "description": "Leave the ordinary behind and discover Laputa, your luxury bamboo sanctuary in the sky. This isn't just a place to stay; it's a front-row seat to a daily spectacle of breathtaking sunrises and endless views that stretch from the ocean to the majestic Mt. Agung. Prepare to be mesmerized by a serenity so profound, you’ll never want to leave.The spaceLaputa #3: Your Castle in the SkyLaputa #3 is a 77 sqm (829 sq ft) bamboo home designed for up to four guests. It features two bedrooms and spectacular 360-degree views of the ocean, mountains, and rice terraces. The owner spent eight months using a drone to meticulously search for Bali's most scenic spot, ultimately discovering this remote, unnamed ridge in Sidemen. The location was so secluded that an access road had to be built just to reach it.Location & VibeTucked away in Sidemen, a tranquil village on the slopes of Mount Agung, Laputa offers a taste of the \"real Bali.\" This isn't a bustling tourist hub; instead, it attracts repeat visitors from Europe who appreciate its authentic culture and serene landscapes. While you'll feel a world away, you're only a 90-minute drive from Bali Airport and an hour from Ubud. The villa also serves as a perfect base for exploring iconic sites like Lempuyang Temple, Besakih, and Tirta Gangga.The Bamboo House: A Unique ExperienceThis isn't just a house; it's a work of art. Crafted from sustainable bamboo, the villa's open design beautifully blurs the line between indoors and nature. All living spaces, bedrooms, and the bathroom are oriented to showcase the breathtaking panorama. At 72 sqm (approx. 775 sq ft), the space feels both intimate and airy, with abundant natural air circulation. You'll never need an air conditioner—the mountain air keeps things comfortably cool, and we provide fans for rare warm days.Important Things to KnowMonkeys: Since September 2023, monkeys have occasionally visited. We coexist with nature and will never harm them, but please follow these simple rules: never feed them, store valuables and food immediately, and close the bamboo curtains at night.Insects & Bugs: This is an open-air home in the heart of nature, so encounters with insects, bugs, and frogs are common. While our beds have mosquito nets, if you are sensitive to insects, this may not be the right fit for you.Internet: We provide pocket WiFi, but due to our remote location, the connection can be slow or occasionally unavailable.Transportation & Services: We are in a secluded spot with no shops or restaurants within walking distance. However, our team can help you arrange for a driver, scooter rentals, or taxis at a reasonable price. Western breakfast is included, and the owner has an Italian/Mexican restaurant just a 15-minute drive away.Hanging Net: The outdoor hanging net has a maximum weight limit of 150kg and is for single-person use only. Please use it at your own risk.Why You'll Love It HereWe've tried to be as honest as possible so you know exactly what to expect. Laputa is for those who want to disconnect and immerse themselves in Bali's natural beauty. Your local host, Wira, lives nearby and can help with everything from arranging private yoga and massages to inviting you to a local village ceremony.In a nutshell:Pros: Unforgettable views, incredible peace and quiet, and a unique opportunity to experience authentic Balinese culture.Cons: A remote location requiring a car for travel, and encounters with insects are part of the experience.If you're seeking a peaceful escape surrounded by nature, we are confident you will love your stay.",

Located 2.5 kilometers from the center of Ubud, in a clean, and green area, this villa is truly unique due to its exceptional location. The spacious bedroom is equipped with a king-size bed for a restful night's sleep. Then, enjoy the breathtaking views of the valley and river while lounging in the luxurious pool. Villa Ubud Valley provides WiFi internet, air conditioning, Netflix, and cleaning service for your convenience.House Rules:⦿ Please respect the local culture, all local Bali and villa assets, and prevent disturbing the peaceful Ubud holiday and living environment with noise or actions that unreasonably affect or disturb others. (Parties and loud music are not allowed)⦿ Children, outside visitors and pets are not allowed at the villa. Only maximum 2 adults with registered ID can stay during the booking. As required by Indonesian Law, you need to share with us a copy of your ID/passport via AirBNB or WA or email before you arrive, or latest by staff picturing your ID, before you receive the key. ⦿ Not allowed to use towels and bed linen for removal of sunblock, oils and make up, that by nearly default destroys the towels and bed linen for future use. NeighborhoodUbud Canyon is located 2.5 kilometers from the center of Ubud, known as the art capital and cultural heart of the Island of the Gods. Here, you will discover ancient temples, majestic royal palaces, the monkey forest, and stunning vistas of lush green hills for an authentic Balinese experience.Guest accessAround or at the villa there is parking space for motorcycles. Cars can be parked on the side of the road where parking would be allowed and when parking spots are available, or with a few car rental - taxi agencies at 100-meter distance. Parking space availability needs to be confirmed first by the Host earliest 1 week before arrival. In general, it is not recommendable to visit Ubud by car since the government has end 2023 forbidden to park cars along the roadside in Ubud in order to reduce traffic jams; by motor bike you can reach Monkey forest in Ubud Centre in 7 to 15 minutes, but in high season or certain peak hours by car Ubud Centre may take 30-60 minutes from any other location in or near Ubud. Motorbikes and car rental transport are the most convenient way of transport. But mind it: Online transport is in general less reliable and less convenient, this contrary to excellent online F&B services.Other things to note⦿ Bali is a tropical island with all of its amazing biodiversity. You may find plenty of various small animals in Bali (during the stay), ranging from the endangered creatures until common house animals you’ve seen every day like harmless Lizard and Gecko or small insects such as ants and mosquitoes. We do our best to do regular pest control in our villa and clean the villa in detail every day. However, we cannot control and guarantee that there will be no insects at all after regularly arranging the treatments. Therefore, we provide mosquito-small insect spray and electric repellent in the villa to make your stay convenient. ⦿ In Bali Humans and Dogs live side by side; you may see dogs on the streets and not being kept in a cage as part of the island’s way of life. ⦿ The lush jungle surrounding the villa is home to playful monkeys that occasionally pass by the river canyon gardens. Their visits vary, sometimes weekly, sometimes every couple of months, depending on food availability in the area. As they naturally roam in search of food, we kindly remind you to keep any snacks or meals secured, as unattended food may attract these curious visitors. To ensure a smooth and enjoyable stay, please be mindful that they might take an interest in any open snacks if left out. We appreciate your understanding and hope you enjoy the unique experience of being close to nature! 😊Included services:Free Balinese coffee, tea, water. For floating breakfast we serve you with a floating tray, then like all our guests enjoyed to fill up the tray with your personal choice out of the hundreds of online available culinary F&B options.Optional services:- Bed linen: Change each 3 daysPrice: Included in the booking.- Towels: Change each 3 daysPrice: Included in the booking.",

  "description": "An expansive Japanese style oasis with the tranquility of the jungle just minutes from the best surf spots and restaurants of Pererenan, Seseh and Canggu. This serene retreat features a spacious teak villa with a cantilevered lap pool, rock gardens, a bamboo forest, large trees and filtered water throughout the house. A blend of traditional architecture and modern comfort, it feels like being in Ubud but just minutes from the coast.The spaceA turn-of-the-century traditional teak building brought over from Java and constructed overhanging the Pererenan river, this property feels remote and peaceful yet it is just minutes from Canggu and the coast. The interior has modern appliances, glass windows and doors, air conditioning and filtered water systems. The design is similar to Japanese-style wooden buildings with clean lines, beautiful wood craft and organic, traditional architecture.The large main living and dining room are 33x38 feet (10x 11.5 meters) looking out across the gardens and pool. The office serves as a second bedroom with rollerblinds to let you sleep in. There is a replica of a 1950s green French sofa designed for an additional person to sleep on.The large bedroom has a large super king size bed (200x200cm or 6.5 sq.ft.), antique copper bed lamps, a custom made headboard and large panel windows looking out into the jungle and down onto the river. There are large cabinets for your clothing and personal items.The master bath has two sinks and a glassed in shower overlooking the river. There is a separate guest bathroom just off the living room.The large lap pool is cantilevered over the river and filtered using a copper iodine system (very low chemical imprint).The house water is fully filtered and drinkable throughout the house. There is a flash heater providing endless hot water supply.The gardens include 80 foot mango trees, timber bamboo and Japanese style rock gardens with water flowing through them.There is an unfinished storage area below the house with a large grass lawn and seating area overlooking the looking.Guest accessYou have private access to the entire property.Ahania Villa is at the back of a Hindu village in Tumbak Bayu on the Pererenan river. There is 70 meters (230 feet) of paved bike and foot path from the street to the house. The house is not accessible by car so be prepared to walk about three minutes down the path and down 25 wide steps to the house. Our staff can meet you and help you with your bags and/or you can use a small cart we have in the bike port to transport bags.Other things to noteAccess to the house requires walking for several minutes down a paved foot path or a 1 minute ride on your motorbike (which we can arrange and have ready for you). We are at the back of a quiet Hindu village on the river. So you are part of a local community which means no loud parties or high volume music after dark.This is the jungle so there are a lot of birds, roosters and insects (ants, cicadas, geckos, local dogs - all cute). If you are looking for an authentic experience this is your place. If you want a concrete modern building fumigated to remove insects, please look somewhere else.The jungle produces a lot of noise in the morning (cicadas and roosters as well as geckos - think 3 foot long geckos). If you require complete quiet in the morning, try one of the hotels downtown.The property is not suitable for children because of the large drop-offs from the pool and bedroom.",

  "title": "The Clove House in Munduk -  Island in the Sky",
  "description": "The Clove House in Munduk is a real gem for all those looking to enjoy the tranquility and amazing beauty of mother nature in a unique and comfortable mountain hut. It is ideal for private yoga or meditation retreats, as well as for writers, painters or couples looking for a romantic getaway in an unbelievable dramatic setting. Walk to Munduks 3 beautiful waterfalls directly from the house and enjoy staying in a world-class minimalist designed home.The spaceLike an island in the sky, the clove house serves the special purpose of bringing people back to nature and their own core self. In a hectic world, filled with material and mental distractions, I see the clove house as a haven for seekers, nature-lovers and practitioners of any spiritual discipline, but also simply as a place to come, relax and get away from it all!The design of the house follows an optimal flow concept, trying to make best use of light, wind, view and the actual site. Even though simple in its layout, lots of conscious selection of materials make it a cute warm “nest” in the middle of nature. Recycled materials, such as rough-surfaced iron wood, have been used for the flooring and recycled teak wood for the sliding doors. Furniture is held minimal, yet comfortable enough to spend a few days in the house. I am personally a big believer in less is more, but still want my place to be comfortable.  Please enjoy!VILLA OVERVIEW - Walk to Munduks amazing waterfalls DIRECTLY from the villa- Private minimalist house in the middle of Bali Jungle with ocean view- Outdoor bathtub with jungle views - King-size Bedroom with 180 degree views- Japanese-inspired bathroom with waterfall-style shower- Large open deck with relaxing chairs and dining area and yoga space- Private garden with sun loungers- Private gym with spin bikes, dumbbell rack and power tower- Free parking space upstairs and access to restaurant- Direct Access to Munduk’s trekking path and waterfalls (closest one about 15 minutes)- Safety box - Fully equipped kitchen- Wi-Fi The house follows the idea of joining elegantly 3 major design influences: modern minimalism, Japanese traditional design, and Balinese Feng Shui. Choosing darker colours and wooden elements give the villa a warmer cozy atmosphere in the colder terrain. There is a big king-size bed with mosquito netting for a comfortable sleep or for those that like to laze around during the day. Via a Japanese style sliding door one can opt to have a view of the jungle while standing under the rainfall shower or step out and take a hot relaxing bath under the sky in the colder evenings.A small but complete kitchen is hidden behind the other door, for those who prefer to cook on their own, or simply to put up the kettle for a hot cup of tea or coffee (provided!). To the front, the veranda opens onto the endless majestic view of Bali’s jungle and ocean.Under the house you will find your own personal gym with spin bikes, a dumbbell rack and a power tower.SERVICESYou can expect clean, simple and friendly service. We are limited in our power to manage the services,  as we outsource/collaborate with Arya Utama Bungalows. Simply be aware, that Munduk is in a rural part of Bali, further away from modern life and people are more simple minded.  Expect basic English-skills ( you may ask Mr. Surya or Mr. Adi for assistance if you have any communication issues).Arya Utama provides a range of simple Balinese food at great prices (I personally recommend the Vegetable curry, Nasi Goreng and Vegetable Soup), that they can bring down to the house at an extra charge of 20%. Last order 6.45pm. Please pre-order your breakfast at the desired time one day before in person or via phone provided in the villa. You may also order breakfast in the morning, but expect some waiting time. Please help yourself with tea and coffee that is already available in the villa.INCLUDED SERVICES: - Choice of different breakfast sets (omlette with toast, jaffle, fried rice, vegetable soup, banana pancake) all served with fresh fruit plate/or fruit juice - Free Coffee, Tea and drinking water in the villa- Free Welcome drink - Housekeeping/Towel change - please order it whenever you need it (otherwise nobody will come to clean in order to guarantee an undisturbed stay)- free Wi-Fi OPTIONAL SERVICES (extra charges apply - it is highly recommended to pre-order services one day before, as it is more difficult to organize in the mountain area): - Airport pick up/drop - other destination pick up/drop- Trekking service - Tour service - Motorbike rental - In-room service at the villa (food prepared by Arya Utama Restaurant, simple Indonesian food, 20% surcharge for delivering downstairs to villa). Last order 6.45pm. - Body Massage & Reflexology in the villaTIPS - One of Bali’s largest markets, providing freshest produce directly from the farms, is situated about 15-20 minute drive, at lake Tamblingan. A good place to stock up on food items should you plan to cook yourself! For longer stays, the staff at Arya Utama might be able to stock you up with simple groceries at the nearby local market (potatoes, carrots, leek, tofu, tempeh, cabbage etc) for a service fee of 100,000 IDR.- Please use the kitchen in a proper way and leave it behind in a clean state. If you find any difficulties (missing objects) please let us know so we can replace or buy them for the next guest and improve our service. Please let the staff at Arya Utama know if the gas is empty/finished and DO NOT change the Gasbottle/regulator by yourself. Please let the staff at Arya Utama know any of the following has run out:Salt/Pepper/Sugar/Coffee/Tea/Cooking Oil/dishwashing liquid – we provide these items in the kitchen free of charge during your stay. There is a French press and Moka machine available for coffee preparation, as well as a tea pot for preparing tea.- Please throw all sanitary napkins, toilet paper, tampons into the garbage bin provided – do not flush down the toilet.Guest accessYou have private access to all the facilities of the house.You will share the parking/restaurant area.From the house you can walk down to Munduk's amazing waterfalls - ENjoy!Other things to noteTHINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE BOOKING:-Please bring enough cash money as the nearest ATM is 20 minute drive-no children under 18 years allowed, as there are very low railings (50cm) and some areas without railing. This is held intentional, so as to give the undisturbed feelings, as well as making the house adult – only. -Refrain from drinking high amounts of alcohol because of the risk of loosing balance and falling over the railing 4 meter.-The hot water is set to VERY HOT (about 70 degrees Celsius), so as to guarantee that the bathtub can be filled up in proper way. Please be  aware of this at all times and take care not to use the hottest setting on your body.-The road down to the house is rather steep and about 5 minute walk to the upper restaurant area – that’s the price we must pay for undisturbed jungle immersion  ☺ We recommend using the food deliver service from the upper restaurant and it costs only 20% extra on top of the cheap local prices.-The road down to the waterfall is natural and might be slippery and steep at times. Please walk slowly.-During rainy season some parts of the paths, as well as the bridge and decking might be slippery. Please walk with caution.-The food provided at the accommodation is simple but good quality Indonesian food. Should you desire more refined cuisine, we recommend to head to Ngiring Ngewedang or to bring items so you can prepare your own meals in the kitchen. You may also try to have your breakfast at the waterfall Golden Valley Eco café below, about 40 minute walk from the house, turning right at the first T-fork.-To guarantee complete privacy, cleaning of the villa will only be carried out when you order it. -Some garden lighting has been set up to illuminate the path down to the house. For ecological purposes we have set the timer to switch the lights on from sunset til 10.30pm. -Even though some natural bamboo has been planted to guarantee some fencing and privacy, the house can be seen from the side by the occasional hiker. A bamboo mat can be pulled down to guarantee more privacy.- The Clove House lies at a higher altitude of 1000m - expect a much milder climate than in the south of Bali. Highly recommended to bring a jumper, sweater, socks and long pants for the fresher evenings.The story behind the Clove HouseInspired by movies such as TOTORO and other Sudio Gilbhi movies, year-long meditation practice and a love for nature, the clove house was born with the intention to bring people back to nature, back to themselves, back to peaceful silent contentment. Having come to Arya Utama over the past 5 years for short-period meditation retreats, somehow I developed an intimate relationship with its surroundings and the owners. The walks one can take to the waterfalls in the area, the endless stunning sunsets over the ocean (in dry season), the sounds of the jungle, the passing clouds, the thundering rain, the dry sunshine, the variety of wildlife, and the smell of clove and coffee in the air (dry season) have made me fall in love with this place and have made it my personal sanctuary to regain energy, vision and focus. May you get the same benefits while staying at this beautiful place on earth!",

It is possible to see insects, geckos or other small animals, and at night the jungle comes to life with sounds of birds, monkeys, frogs and more. Especially in the early morning, roosters can sing and make sounds, something very common in rural environments very rooted in their culture. This is part of the authentic experience of staying in a natural paradise. We do our best to make the house comfortable, but we recommend keeping doors and windows closed at night and using repellent if needed.",

  "description": "Set in the quiet hills of Uluwatu, this villa is a peaceful spot made for surfers, design lovers, and anyone who wants to slow down. Built with reclaimed teak and raw stone, it opens to the breeze and the sound of cowbells in the distance. There are three private bedrooms, a kitchen made for sharing, a pool that slips into the living space, and rooftop sunsets. It’s soulful, grounded in nature, and unlike anything else in Uluwatu.The spaceThis villa was designed to feel like a lived-in surf retreat—somewhere to return to, not just stay.There are three private bedroom retreats, each with its own distinct character. Set apart from one another, all bedrooms are air-conditioned and open onto private outdoor terraces, offering quiet space to lounge, rest, or read in the shade. Each room has an ensuite bathroom—two open-air, one fully enclosed—all with their own sense of calm and connection to the outdoors.Whether you're traveling with friends, family, or a partner, you’ll always have space to retreat and reset, never feeling crowded or on top of each other.At the heart of the villa is a striking open-plan living area, built into the shell of the old villa and beneath the soaring alang-alang roof of a 120-year-old Javanese Limasan. Here, the pool extends under the roofline, meeting a large, comfortable lounge where you can stay close to the water all day. A floating platform rests beside the couch, perfect for sunbathing, reading, or dipping your feet. There's a projector for movie nights, a fully equipped kitchen with a large island, and a generous dining table made for shared meals and long conversations.Music is part of the rhythm here—guitars (acoustic and electric) are available for guests to play, and a record player with a growing vinyl collection sets the mood for slow mornings or late afternoons. Whether you're sharing a quiet moment with a favorite album or strumming something of your own, there’s space to let sound become part of your stay.A rooftop deck offers a quiet spot to catch the breeze, with cozy seating and views of Uluwatu’s hills and the distant ocean—ideal for sunset drinks or stargazing after dinner. And in the garden below, a stone firepit is tucked into the landscape, ready for cool evenings and fireside chats under the stars. And if you’re the curious type, you might find a hidden loft tucked into the rafters—a playful little room that adds a touch of surprise to the stay.Guest accessYou’ll have full access to the entire villa, including all three private bedroom suites, the hidden loft, the open-plan living and dining areas, the rooftop deck, and the expansive garden with its tucked-away firepit.The property is entirely private—no shared spaces. Wander freely, lounge in the shade of the teak trees, or enjoy quiet corners throughout the home and garden. This is your space to settle in and slow down.Other things to noteThe villa is fully up and running, but still evolving—some art, planting, and small touches are still being added. Early guests are part of this quiet unfolding, and we appreciate your presence during this final phase.The garden is large and still being developed, including work on a rainwater system to make the property more sustainable. It’s not disruptive, and we’ve done our best to maintain full privacy.Staff are on-site each morning to quietly tidy up, and can help with things like preparing the roof deck for sunset or lighting the firepit.We use regular pest control, but this is a home open to nature—geckos, frogs, and bugs may stop by.For everyone’s safety, smoking is not permitted inside the villa. Guests may smoke in the garden area or near the firepit, where ashtrays can be provided on request.Please take care, as the alang-alang thatched roof—while beautiful—is naturally flammable. We appreciate your understanding.Please note the pool is open to the living space, and the loft—though fun—is accessed by ladder and has windows that must be locked if children are inside.",

Nature’s Residents – A True Jungle ExperienceNestled deep in nature, our open-air bamboo villa offers an immersive experience in Sidemen’s vibrant ecosystem. You may encounter friendly insects, frogs, lizards, or other jungle creatures during your stay — these are part of the charm of living so close to nature. While we maintain the villa with great care, occasional visits from these residents are natural due to the open design. To help keep things comfortable, we provide natural incense sticks and recommend turning off unnecessary lights at night, which can reduce insect activity. Should you need any assistance, our team is always happy to help.2.     WeatherBali has a tropical climate, and sudden rain showers can happen at any time—especially in Sidemen. We provide umbrellas for your convenience. Please take extra care when walking on wooden stairs or decking, as surfaces can become slippery when wet. We appreciate your understanding and wish you a comfortable stay, rain or shine.3.\tWater, Electricity & Wi-FiThe villa’s water supply comes from the local water company and is sourced from the Mount Agung aquifer. While the water is fresh and safe for showering and cleaning, we kindly ask that you drink only the filtered or bottled water provided. Refills are available upon request — just let our team know. Electricity and Wi-Fi are generally stable, but as we’re located in a natural area, occasional fluctuations may occur. We appreciate your understanding and will do our best to resolve any issues quickly. 3.\tHanging Net UsageOur bamboo villa features a beautiful hanging net — a serene spot to relax, read, or take in the breathtaking views of the valley. While it’s designed to be safe and inviting, we kindly ask guests to use it with care and at their own risk. The net can support up to one person. Please avoid standing, jumping, or placing excessive weight on it. When crossing, maintain three points of contact for balance and refrain from sitting on the edges. For your safety, jumping into the pool from the net is strictly prohibited. If you have any questions or need assistance, our team is always happy to help.4.\tLocal Laws and noise policyOur retreat is nestled in the peaceful village of Tebola, where the sounds of nature and the rhythm of local life set the tone. To honor this serenity and respect our neighbours, we kindly ask guests to observe quiet hours after 10 PM. Please also be mindful of local customs and community expectations during your stay. We truly appreciate your cooperation in helping us preserve the tranquil spirit of this beautiful place.5.\tSecurity and SafetyYour comfort and peace of mind are our priority. The bedroom locks from both inside and outside for added security. Sidemen is a safe and deeply welcoming community. Your local host, Kadek, is a respected member of the village, and here, everyone is either family or a friend — creating an atmosphere of trust and genuine hospitality. While the surroundings are tranquil, we still encourage guests to take usual precautions, as they would anywhere.6. Transport ServicesYou’re welcome to use online platforms like Grab/Gojek to reach the villa. However, due to Sidemen’s remote location and local driver protections, ordering transport from the village can be more challenging. For a smoother experience, we’re happy to arrange a trusted private driver for you—available for both arrival and departure. We take no commission; 100% of the payment goes to the driver. Rates typically range between IDR 300K and 600K, depending on your pickup or drop-off location.7. Dining Options Available NearbyThere are plenty of great dining options within a 5–25 minute walk from the villa, offering both Indonesian and international cuisine.

  "description": "There's nothing more peaceful than finding yourself in a tranquil hideaway surrounded by lush landscapes & modern amenities. At Tempat Santai Bali, you'll experience just that. Our villa features spacious living areas, a fully-equipped kitchen, & a private pool that overlooks the captivating Ayung Ridge. Each corner of this serene retreat is designed to offer you the ultimate relaxation & rejuvenation. Come & immerse yourself in the peaceful ambiance & luxurious comforts of this idyllic getaway.Other things to noteMEALS:Start your day off right with quality breakfast! We've got you covered with a variety of ingredients to fuel your morning. From a vibrant tropical fruit salad to fluffy scrambled eggs and toast, the possibilities are endless.  No matter what you choose, you can't go wrong.  Go ahead, indulge a little. You deserve itPOLICY:For safety reasons, our property cannot accept children under 16 years old. Our location on the ridge includes areas without railings, an infinity pool that is not gated, and various staircases inside and outside the property, posing a risk of falling. Therefore, our property is strictly for adults only.INSECTS and BUGSWe are in a tropical setting; therefore bugs, insects, frogs, snakes and other crawlers are part of our ecosystem. We coexist with nature and wish to provide this experience to our guests. We have plenty of butterflies but there is no way we can have only them and not other insects around. Our property is fully enclosed, and our dedicated staff maintain a high level of cleanliness. However, being situated in Ubud's lush tropical setting means occasional visitors from nature may appear. To minimize encounters, we kindly remind you to keep doors closed. While we can't guarantee their absence, we take every precaution to ensure your comfort. If you spot any unwanted guests, please inform our butler, and we'll take prompt action.You might encounter geckos. They are completely harmless but they sometimes make their distinctive sound at night. The good thing is that geckoes are very efficient in keeping the rooms clear of insects, so in fact we do appreciate these useful animals. In our vast garden we also have plenty of squirrels, birds and lizards. At sunset you will see several kinds of bats and you will hear symphony of sounds from the jungle. When it gets dark the fireflies might come around. The intensity of the nature in our location can be a bit overwhelming for some people, so please consider if this concept is for you.",

Pool:Please note that the swimming pool is part of the common area and accessible for all our guests regardless which cabin they booked.Location:Welcome to the other side of Bali.Nestled in Kintamani, a mountainous volcanic region in northern Bali, our location features dense forests and a cooler climate, particularly refreshing at night and quite contrary to what is expected from a tropical island and is the perfect destination to complete your Bali trip. Batur Cabins sits at an elevation of 1,500 meters, offering unparalleled views of the surrounding lava fields, majestic volcanoes, and the tranquil crater lake. Kindly be advised to pack warmer clothing for your stay with us, as Kintamani experiences a cooler climate compared to the rest of tropical Bali.

Although we provide cozy blankets and a fireplace, we recommend bringing warmer clothing for ultimate comfort during the cooler evenings. The temperatures are varying from 26°C during the day to 16-17°C at night time.Access:Although Batur Cabins is only a few minutes from the main road with several coffee shops, restaurants and convenience stores, it is situated on the hillside just below the village. Its tranquil setting amidst nature also means that access may not be immediately obvious.You can reach the Batur Cabins property via a small street near the temple, requiring a short but steep 150-meter walk downhill. Our team will meet you at our designated meeting point just minutes away from your cabin and escort you to the property.

Our cabins are meticulously designed to offer guests an unforgettable experience. Located on the slope of a mountain, the cabins are elevated on columns to provide the best possible views. As a result, most of our cabins and facilities are several meters above the ground, making them unsuitable for young children.Children aged 12 and above are welcome to stay with us when accompanied by an adult. In specific cases please fell free to contact us.Guest accessAccess to Batur Cabins:We’re proud of the tranquil hideaway we’ve created at Batur Cabins — tucked into a peaceful hillside, surrounded by nature, and offering unobstructed views of Mount Batur and the stunning volcanic scenery of Kintamani. Though just a short walk from the main road with cafés, restaurants, and shops, it feels like a world away — the perfect place to disconnect, recharge, and fully relax.Access to the cabins involves a short but steep 150-meter walk downhill via a small street near the village temple.

  "description": "The Glassvillas is Bali’s first-ever glasshouse, nestled in the foothills surrounding Lovina. Our Glasshouse is designed for those seeking a unique stay with some of the most breathtaking views of the North Bali coastline.The spaceThe GlasshouseOur Glasshouse is designed for those who seek a truly unique, one-of-a-kind experience. Nestled in the serene foothills surrounding Lovina Beach, our Glasshouse has an incredible infinity pool with breathtaking views of North Bali's coastline. The Glasshouse offers an unparalleled opportunity to sleep under the stars, surrounded by panoramic glass that provides an immersive connection to the lush, tropical landscape. As night falls, the distant city lights of Singaraja twinkle like stars on the horizon, while the real celestial stars glitter above. Whether you're basking in our infinity pool or relaxing inside, our aim is to offer you a super unique experience, for your trip to North Bali!Guest accessOur caretaker will greet you on arrival, show you around and be there to help you with anything during your stay.Other things to note- LocationSituated in the foothills overlooking Lovina, The Glassvillas offers a serene escape just 15 minutes by car or scooter from shops, restaurants, and convenience stores. While our secluded location ensures peace, relaxation, and stunning views, it does mean transport options can be a bit limited. Gojek taxis or bikes are occasionally available but can be intermittent, so having your own car or scooter is generally the easiest way to get around. We’re happy to assist with bike hire or arranging a private taxi for you.For food, Grab delivery is usually reliable, especially if you order from Coffeenosky, a fantastic café in Lovina known for its great coffee and delicious café meals. It’s a convenient and tasty option for dining during your stay!- BreakfastOur villa comes stocked with cereal and milk for a light start to your day, but a cooked breakfast is not included. For something extra special, we offer a beautifully presented breakfast served in a heart-shaped basket. This stunning breakfast for two can be enjoyed floating in your pool or served poolside—your choice! The cost for this memorable experience is 500K IDR. It’s a lovely way to begin your day in paradise.- Nearby Restaurants and ShopsThe Glassvillas is located 15 minutes by car or scooter from Lovina, where you’ll find shops, restaurants, bars, and Pepito, the largest supermarket in North Bali. While our secluded location offers unmatched tranquility and breathtaking views, it’s best to plan ahead and bring along any food or supplies you’d like during your stay. This way, you can fully relax and enjoy the peaceful surroundings without the need for frequent trips into town.- Adult-Only PolicyAs much as we love children, our villa is not equipped to accommodate them. We are an adult-only accommodation, and guests must be 17 years or older.- EnvironmentThe Glassvillas is set on a picturesque, working mango farm, offering incredible views and a peaceful retreat. Being immersed in nature also means insects are part of the experience, particularly after rain, during the wet season, or at night. If you open the Glasshouse wide during these times, there’s a high chance bugs will make their way inside. To avoid this, we recommend keeping the doors closed when not in use. However, we understand the allure of opening up the space to fully enjoy the scenery! For those moments, we’ve provided insect LED lights, which, while not perfect, can help manage any unexpected visitors. It’s all part of embracing the beauty of nature!",

The villa’s mantra is ‘Passionate Serenity’ — and we truly believe you will find it here.Located near the quiet coastal village of Saba, this iconic beach-front property sits serenely on the lip of the quiet Peanut River, overlooking the black sands of Saba beach. Revitalizing treatments for mind, body and soul through yoga and spa treatments are a highlight of a stay at The Ylang Ylang.Approached through Saba village, with its idyllic scenery of verdant rice fields and coconut groves, this beachfront property resting on landscaped gardens and facing the Indian Ocean’s crashing surf is a spectacular sight. Built in 2002 and lovingly designed and furnished by its owner, Villa Ylang Ylang hints of Versace and European sophistication: an elegant black and gold theme permeates throughout, while furnishings are fashioned from the finest imported fabrics. Food is served on gold plates, pool towels are by Chanel and several precious glass sculptures by the celebrated Japanese Artist Seiki ornament the villa. Guests have included international celebrities and royalty, discreetly served by the experienced yet charming villa staff.Villa Ylang Ylang, however, is much, much more than a luxury beachside residence. The villa is named after the fragrant Ylang Ylang flower, renowned for bringing harmony, peace, warmth and passion, and its mantra is ‘passionate serenity’, which is exactly what you will find here.
